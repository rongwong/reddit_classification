"need help finding an old sci-fi movie or tv episode alright  i have this memory from when i was a kid, no older than 5. i was with  my dad and we were watching tv, although i'm not sure if it was a movie  or show.

i remember a crew from  what i think was a spaceship. i believe they landed on an alien planet  and for some reason the door that led to the outside was stuck open. on  the outside of the door, was some kind of alien or monster (or possibly  even a natural disaster like a storm or something catastrophic). it was  never shown as i believe it was far away, but you could hear it getting  louder and louder as the film/show progressed, and the crew were  frantically trying to fix either the door or the ship to escape the  imminent danger.  i remember what i believe to be a jungle outside the  door, but it could have been other scenery. as i said i had to be 5 or  younger so i may have perceived some of this incorrectly.

i  posted this over on the /startrek sub and while we narrowed down that  it probably wasn't from that show, someone did point me to the 1956 film  forbidden planet. i watched it, and there are scenes in the movie that  do seem similar. particularly when the soldiers are stranding under the  spaceship preparing for the giant invisible monster. maybe what i'm  remembering as a doorway was simply the ship over-hanging above them.  but i want to be sure, so i figured i would look here. thanks for any  and all help!",1

i thought it would be easy as, however using the quotes database and typing in 'what is it' results in almost every film that has 'what' in it!

so, can some of you please tell me what films have that classic quote of ""what is it"" or anything similar (i.e. in alien ripley says ""what kind of thing?"" and in cabin in the woods one character says ""what is that thing?"".

"art-heavy, sci-fi, nyu thesis film needs help hi!

i’m an nyu student filmmaker raising funds for my senior thesis film. it’s a story about a robotic farmhand and involves heavy art direction in order to build a world that is both authentic to the sci-fi genre and also realistic for a low budget shoot.

&gt;*synopsis: “techno scrap” tells the story of m0, a lonesome robotic farmhand who spends his days in a strict pattern of rising early to maintain livestock and land. a hug from his owner’s young daughter interrupts this, and m0 becomes so intrigued by love that he begins to study and incorporate it into his encoded routine. when tragedy strikes on the farm, m0 must step up to the task and restore order, but his newfound sensibility presents him with an emotional dilemma: can concealing the truth bond a family?*

m0 carries this narrative, and the audience should connect with him intimately. m0 will be a played by an actor wearing a full practical costume, allowing him to react to his surroundings and supporting characters. when he gets muddy it’ll be real mud. when he lingers, glances, or reaches out for love, it will be under the full control of the actor. construction is currently underway.

&gt;link to m0 concept art: [https://i.imgur.com/wrpkeuv.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/wrpkeuv.jpg)

my production team has created a budget and begun fundraising for our shoot on a farm in march, but we need lots of help! i want to involve the sci-fi community from all corners of the internet to fund this film. people interested in science, technology, robotics, artificial intelligence, and also character &amp; costume design and sci-fi art direction / world-building, etc. will love to see the their interests come together to enrich a dramatic narrative.

**whatever you can spare, we will gratefully accept. so much as a couple of bucks and a like &amp; share on facebook or instagram will mean the world to us.**

i've been trying to figure out the title for a movie that i've seen maybe twice in my life, once when i was a kid, once a couple years back on comet....

1980s movie. a ridley scott's ""alien"" and william malone's ""creature"" rip off. an alien comes to earth, it's black and has a mouth full of white/clear obelisk shaped teeth. looks a lot like the aliens in both of the above movies. its set somewhere in the midwest. the main characters are people who work in a police station. one of them is a middle age pretty blonde who is pursued by a detective who can ""broil a mean steak"". he literally mentions broiling a steak like four times and even has a scene where he's making one for his date.

 the male character looks like the guy who plays futterman in gremlins but it's not the same guy, he has a deeper voice. in the end, there's a big showdown with the blonde and the detective in a warehouse, im pretty sure they electrocute the alien to kill it. i'm totally reaching here...if anyone wants to ask questions, i will happily oblige with an answer.  ",1

the first one:

it was made in the 80's or 70's or possibly the 60's. the movie was about a group of people who believed that something was going to come for them and they would live earth off forever. it was like a cult much like heaven's gate. at the end of the movie they were in a building with many lights at night but a young man refused to get inside the building even thought he was part of the cult. the young man stayed outside all night. the next morning everybody had disappeared inside the building and the young man stood outside while someone was playing a flute.

the second one:

it was made in the 80's or 70's or possibly the 60's. the plot was that there was a plane that disappeared inside a storm for some minutes. and then appeared again. at the end of the movie, we find out that the passengers were replaced by android\-like beings much like the terminator. robot\-like interior with a human skin exterior.

"best &amp; worst 2018 sci-fi movie i've seen so far (1st quarter) best: the gateway (australian)
from the beginning it appeared the budget was low considering the special effects and cheap visuals &amp; specialfx in the lab(s). however, the acting, storyline, and finale were all awesome. this movie has you in suspense and in moral dilemma from beginning to end; really makes you brainstorm and sort of be better prepared for confronting quantum entanglement. uplifting!

worst: annihilation (british-american)
starts off so big-budget with vivid psychedelic imagery but the acting, storyline, and finale are all so painful to endure for 2 hours; should have been a 15min (maximum) short film since its just about some anomaly that appears on earth that entraps and mutates everything (tll 'annihilation'); engulfing earth with not even a hope or attempt to remedy. throughout the film i wondered if the author/screenwriter/director/etc was schizophrenic or just on acid while constructing this madness. horribly depressing from beginning to end as all the characters are monotonously negative. after watching, was perplexed to find out director also did ex machina, as ex machina was awesome! blame the different authors too i guess, but i won't bother watching another eric garland movie because of how poorly annihilation was directed despite stunning visuals.

"why is the future either (a) dystopian or (b) infested with aliens that want to eat us? the top two scifi franchises of all time are star trek and star wars.  the first is arguably far more utopian in its themes, but even star wars pits good against evil in archetypal terms.  after these, every science fiction film or series that i can think if presents a dystopian future, or digresses into some version of the standard monster movie.  and producers wonder why they flop.

here is my theory:  producers keep getting scripts from 20-something hacks who think dystopias are edgy and smart.  or they default to the b-movie monster theme.  they seem blind to the surprisingly successful money-making theme of a utopian future.  people are tired of bleak futures.  show us what could be if we listen to the better angels of our nature.

question:  why are there no movies that present a positive view of the future.  sure, even star trek is full of philosophical dilemmas and bad guys, but the common thread is a future where diverse people and species should get along.  or at least try.",1

"80s/90s movie, ends in an airplane graveyard trying to track down a movie i remember renting (vhs) as a kid, probably late 80s could have been early 90s. centers around one man, a citizen in a stratified society in wartime. he gets tricked into running some ""black ops"" (breaking into a secured building to get some data or something). he finally manages to escape to 'enemy territory' and it's an abandoned airstrip with inoperable planes decaying on the tarmac. he's greeted by his 'handler' and learns the truth - the war has been over for a long time, but the society he fled has come to depend on the state of perpetual warfare, so the myth persists... any ideas? thanks!!",1

"best space battle to watch on a big-screen tv? i just recently got a 40"" television for the first time, and i am a fan of many types of science fiction movies.  i was 6 in 1977, so you know star wars is huge with me; also, battlestar galactica; firefly; alien(s); sunshine; star trek.  

can anyone recommend a movie with a great space battle, so i can enjoy it on my new tv?  one of my favorites of all time was the battle of new caprica on bsg.  also, of course, the death star battles.  if you can think of a (pretty) good movie with a great battle scene, i'd appreciate it.  thanks!",1
"need help identifying old scifi movie about time travel i remember watching a scifi movie that was made either in the 50's or 60's. the protagonists, i think they were scientists, were doing some experiments with time travel. at the very end of the movie after concluding their experiments, the protagonists, a man and a woman, iirc, exit the facility where they were working only to find that time had stopped all around them. does anyone know this movie? i've been trying to look for it for years.",1
"trying to find a mid 2000's movie..... this may well be two different movies but the first scene i  remember is a futuristic world where there is some military/police patrolling the streets with these poorer, uglier people treated almost as kos. a soldier drives by in his tank car and spots a naked ( or almost naked) girl unconscious huddled on a street corner and picks her up to put her in the back of his tank truck car. he puts a blanket over her (obviously showing compassion for the situation and tryingn to be a good person. as he starts driving away, she wakes up and slowly and quietly gets up, sliding a blade out (unsure where it was hidden since she was naked or almost naked) and as the soldier is talking on his radio she slits his throat wide open and as he is bleeding out he drops a grenade that blows the truck up.

the next scene i remember is some chase scene where there is a massive truck being marauded by some grungy raider bad guys. there's a blonde soldier chick driving the truck and one of the marauders manages to climb onto the roof and managed to lean over to the windshield and shoot the driver in her throat with some kind of crossbow. she's obviously freaked out and panicking, clutching the bolt and trying to breathe as the truck goes out of control. the next thing i remember was either the truck flips and everyone is killed once the marauders search the truck or the passenger of the truck manages to get control of it once the driver dies.

i've been trying to find these movies i saw on tv once a few years back and haven't been able to figure out what they were. moods anyone have an idea what the movie(s) were called?",1

"thoughts on ""the autopsy of jane doe"" just finished watching ""the autopsy of jane doe"" for the first time. for those who've seen it, what did you think?

personally, i enjoyed it, though i felt the ending could've been resolved more. most horror movies today don't really scare me because of their predictability and overuse of common horror tropes (e.g. moving into a new house, finding an abandoned place, etc.). don't get me wrong, horror tropes were present, like some jump-scares and a witchcraft element, but i don't think they were tasteless. i felt genuinely creeped out.

i liked how long it took to uncover the mystery of jane doe. although it was easy to infer it was going to be something satanic or ritualistic, finding out about her different injuries along with the father and son was intriguing.

despite enjoying the film, i did have a few criticisms, but they're mostly nitpicky...

the song's girlfriend dying was traumatic and a bit of a twist, yes, but i found it unnecessary and illogical. yes, it makes sense that she returned for their date, but the fact that she didn't speak at all was odd. considering the ominous ambiance of the hallway she was in, i don't understand why she didn't call out. sure, i guess it could be chocked up to jane doe's tricks, but still... i feel like it could've been more devastating for her to show up on the scene after the fact; it would've been plausible that she got stuck in the flash flood the radio host talked about.

moving forward, the bible reference, leviticus 27, was not accurate to most translations, whether it be niv, kjv, or another. i'm not religious, but i do like things to be realistic. (yes, i understand the irony in that considering i watched a horror movie about a cursed witch corpse, but i mean realistic in terms of fact-finding and decision-making.) in the film, we literally see the text they're reading from and it has the word ""witch"". most versions say ""unclean spirit"" in that instance. you can infer that this implies witchcraft or any other blasphemous alignment. now, unless they had a really old text from around the 17th century, which is obscure and therefore unlikely, i doubt it would outright say ""witch"". however, i understand that it was for the audience's comprehension. the peculiar nature of jane doe's corpse appearing old and new (in regards to how long she'd been dead) paired with the northeastern origins hypothesis unravels without the word ""witch"". essentially, saying ""unclean spirit"" dismantles the ""old but new"" characteristic of her corpse. again, i understand why it had to be done, but still...

i also wish the father and son talked a tiny bit more about this possible spell that they theorize was used on jane doe. even if they were incorrect, spitballing in that instance seemed like a natural thing to do to try and get to the bottom of things. i'm a little surprised the word ""necromancy"" wasn't brought up at least once. like, the ritual could've been performed by puritanical priests with the goal of keeping her dead and her spirit trapped. when the father simply said ""[the ritual] didn't work"" i found it a little too vague. i know i just complained about guiding the audience with the whole leviticus thing, but i think hypothesizing the ritual's purpose would've made logical sense, especially for someone like the father who is all about finding cods.

tl;dr, i know. sorry, i just analyze the hell out of movies. so, yeah, if you've seen it, i'd like to know how you did or didn't like it.",0

"help finding an elusive zombie movie! okay. i watched this movie over a decade ago on netflix, back when streaming was really just starting to take off. it was about a guy traveling alone across a desert during a zombie apocalypse type scenario. if he encountered a zombie, he'd punch them to death. 

he found an isolated house with survivors in it - a man and woman who were in a romantic relationship and the woman's sister. the man had a ""sexy"" zombie secretly tied up in a shed out back, and i believe he engaged in adult type activities with said zombie. the woman's sister had a face on her abdomen that could talk... i think it was explained that it was a conjoined twin type situation.

"searching for this old horror movie when i was younger, i saw a trailer for this old horror movie on youtube. it freaked me out and i forgot what it was even called. theres only a few solid details i can really recall:
- the film had to be made during late 60s to mid 70s as it was in color. 

-theres an old house where the central plot takes place. it might be an old antebellum style mansion (maybe something like disneys haunted mansion ride, i think). the house was in the middle of nowhere but under a thick forest 

-there were two female stars; and old woman (probably owner of the old home) and a younger woman. the younger of the two wore an old dress - perhaps the setting of the film is in the 1800's?

-the plot centered around the house. there was either something living beneath the stairs or on the property. 

- theres one scene where the younger woman is climbing the stairs, stops half way up, and stares up at the camera. 


i understand this is alot of information about something i remeber from nearly a decade ago, but i feel it's one of the biggest mysteries i've had in my personal life - more so now that i'm a fan of old-school horror and thrillers. i've tried my best to look into it to no avail.

-the strangers
-irreversible
-a haunting in connecticut
-the autopsy of jane doe
-funny games
-i saw the devil
-almost all of the rob zombie films
-orphan (or something like that)

it wasn't at all what i thought it would be. because so many people were talking about it i though it would be hight quality cameras, different angles and all of that crap. no, it is a found foutage creepy ass shit.

i would've slept better tonight if they actually cought the witch on camera. i swear.

it’s just them getting lost, and arguing, shouting all the time, slowly going crazy. the tention never stop it kept on piling up. not even the short breaks would help. like mike starting to laugh out of nowhere and later on singing some song with josh. it was so short of a break that it didn't matter.

"the conjuring 2 discusions are open i have to admit i was wrong and at the same time right. the conjuring 2 rebutted me for it wasn't a desperate attempt to give the audience the same feeling the first movie did. it was just as creepy and scary.
but i was right that the connection is poor. we were faced with a completely new demon and family, completely other plot that was in no way connected to the first one. the young couple fighting the demon was the only thing that remained the same. a little bonus was the expansion of lorrain's powers. we got to see more of what she feels and sees, not just a briefe explanation with a few creepy shots. though i think they used this to fill up a little time and make the movie deeper with the lore cause the plot this time was too simple.
i will forever keep returning to paranormal activity and say that it did it better. as well as supernatural. it may be a little too long of a series but it's worth every second.

i have a little more time now. i think of watching the blair witch project",0
"i just watched the conjuring the movie is great! no doubt, creepy and scary. well structured. the plot may be simple but if it were complicated it wouldn't have been that real. i liked where it started, where it went. how the two families got together and how the problem was revieled but not yet fixed. the bigger part of the movie is finding out what's wrong but the scarier part is fixing the problem.
i only have one problem. it ends in such a way that all questions you have are already answered. and even though the couple say they have another case at the end you already know that this is their job and it will either be successful or horibly failed.
it feels like the second movie will be a desparate attempt to do as good as the first one. the only same thing will be the doll and the curse. everything else will be far from this story.

this is where i pull back and say paranormal activity did it better. yes, they do introduce new families two but still managed to connect them with the other ones.

things, animals, people, all end up going up the ol exhaust pipe.

then the dude befriends a guy who is a detective, and things really start moving from there.

"dead heat i've been watching a bunch of joe bob lately, which i'm sure is pretty obvious at this point.

that said, i never heard of this film or even knew of it's existence. 

one of the things i love the most about his show is finding new things. 

anyway, this movie resides somewhere between a comedy and a horror, but it really fails at both.

its a buddy cop story with joe piscopo and treat williams as two lethal weapon-esque buddy cops. they run into some zombie criminals and chaos ensues.

thats about it. the rest of the movie is near nonsensical and only exists as a way to deliver more zombies and more smart-ass one liners from piscopo.

it's not good in any traditional way that a horror or comedy film should be, since it's not funny or scary, but its still a fun, entertaining watch. 

the makeup and special effects are good, so there's that.

2/4. watch it if you're bored.

"1br i'm always a fan of movies where people get stuck in a thing or situation and have to escape in some way.

i know its been done and i know it's nothing unique, but i still enjoy them, even the bad ones like vile.

so, this is both bad and not bad. there's a lot of good ideas here and there's a story that has potential to be interesting and tense, even if it doesn't do much new or different.

that said, there's 2 things that make this fall apart for me. 

1 is the acting. the lead specifically was really wooden and her reactions were very.. muted. i always say you know a performance is bad when you can tell the actor is acting, and with her i could tell in almost every scene. there were a few performances that weren't horrible, but nothing i'd call good. i will give a shout out to the lady that played pepper on ahs freak show. one of the two seasons of ahs i could stomach.  

the other is the cinematography and editing. the shots were very awkward and i dont think they captured anything in any interesting way. they were functional but bland, kind of like the 80 cent wheat bread you buy at walmart. its bread, but its not what i'd call especially good. there were many shots that also felt awkward and cobbled together and kind of nonsensical as to why they exist in the form they're in.

regardless of that, it does manage to create some tension and keeps it up effectively in key scenes, even if the story beats are painfully predictable. 

anyway, its worth a watch if you like this kind of thing. if not, you'll probably be bored.

2.5/4 check it out maybe 

did anyone else get strong wafts of scientology from this? like, dead leader, forced into a cultist community, everyone adheres to nonsense and pretends to be happy?

it felt pretty on the nose to me, but, i enjoy reading about cults so i could be connecting dots in the wrong order.",0

"patchwork https://m.imdb.com/title/tt4929720/trivia?ref_=m_tt_trv_trv

streaming on shudder.

cheesy, low budget, comedy shlock. if these things interest you then this movie is something you'll want to see.

its heavily influenced by reanimator, and even thanks stuart gordon in the credits. in the beginning you'll even see a syringe of glowing green liquid.

the acting is passable, but never too serious. the acting and voice acting from the lead character(s) is also passable, but possibly a little hammed up.

the sound design is mostly good, my only complaint being that like many low-budget movies, its all pretty obviously added over the top of the video. sometimes there's sound effects where they dont need to be and sometimes there's no sound when there should be.

all that said, the comedy is slapstick and is hit or miss, but usually hits. dont expect tucker and dale levels of humor, but theres still some chuckles to be had occasionally. 

if you're in the mood for cheesy schlock, give it a watch. 

3 outta 4. check it out.",0

i've been saying that a lot lately, i'm becoming more convinced that it's worth the money.

hell i'd pay 6 a month just for joe bob.

anyway, this movie is made by the same people who made yellowbrickroad.

love or hate that one, you're right. i liked it because the story was weird and it was absolutely unique. it was also cheap and cheesy and asked for a lot of patience while the story went nowhere. i could see opinions going either way though.

this movie is hard to talk about without spoiling anything, so i won't. it needs to be experienced first hand and blind to get the full effect. 

it's kind of slow, its psychological, it's weird, it's creepy and very existentially unsettling. 

all that said, a lot of it reminded me a lot of the sixth sense, but more... i don't know. just more.

favorite grind house exploitation film? hard question but if i had to choose only one i would go with cannibal holocaust. it may be cliche by now to say that’s your favorite of those type of films. but it was ahead of its time. the first half hour is not so great in my opinion and i hate the killing of live animals but that last hour or so is mind blowing. what a intense movie and i can see why the actors had to appear in court. it’s the closest thing i’ve seen movie wise that resembles real found footage. it’s hyper realistic. it’s not my favorite horror film of all time. but when it comes to exploitation or italian horror to me it’s the best. what’s yours?,0

"the dirties this wasn't what i was expecting. 

i saw this one shudder today and the description was interesting so i figured i'd check it out.

i was hooked immediately, but i was also initially confused about why it was on shudder.

it starts off as a weird hybrid of a found footage and teen comedy, like american vandal, but at a certain point not too far in you begin to see interjections of darkness in the movie. 

at some point it becomes something much different and turns into a gritty, real, dark and disturbing film.

very well made, very funny, very clever. lots of nods to classic cinema and a lot of jokes only movie buffs would get.

i found the movie had a very m. night shyamalan feel.  almost like what the village should have been. 

i didn't find the deaths as anything special.  the old man's death felt like the director was trying too hard.  the guy landed on his face and he survives with a broken leg. the proceeding smashes to the face was over kill after the first one. 

please don't get me wrong i found it a very interesting movie. i do think that the society's drug use should have been more prominent.  my main thought was that there was a lot going on, but nothing was kept secret to the viewer.

"comfessional (shudder exclusive) i love shudder, i really do. 

i also love that it's creating new, original content for the horror community. 

this movie however was not for me. my god it was hard to finish. 

so, a series of characters are introduced one by one in a booth with some cameras and sound proofing lining the walls. 

they are then forced to talk non stop and are only let out when they have ""confessed"" honestly about the events that led to the death of 2 characters. 

i like the setup. i always enjoy movies about characters that are trapped in a situation and have to find a way out.

in this case, it doesn't work.

given that the booth doesn't have much interaction with the story or add much in the way of story beats, all you're left with is the characters. 

in order for that setup to work, you need to care about the characters, and i didn't, not a single one of them. there was nothing interesting or gripping or exciting about any of them, from their cookie cutter teen horror identities, to their acting and personalities, there was just nothing. it was hollow and vapid and vacuous and pointless.

i just didn't care.

"looking for name of horror movie the movie i’m looking for was on netflix around 2009 or so. it’s very similar to paranormal activity but not popular. it’s about a family being terrorized by a ghost/demon and most everyone dies. it is set in the modern day in a rural probably two story high class house.

the reason for for this post is because i am looking to watch a scene again that is burned into my mind. it is of a possessed (girl?) that has been bloodied up after killing a family member. the entire scene i think is in night vision. the girl walks into view and we can see her from the waist up. she is in a bedroom from what i can remember. all she does is stand there with her arms oddly in front of her chest and staring at the camera for 20 seconds. sent chills down my spine.

some other odd details from the movie i can remember is that the possessed person had wicked telekinetic powers at one point. also, the end of the movie has the last surviving family member walking through the woods or cave and finds some sort of ritual and dies.

it’s not a popular or big name movie, but if anyone can help me find this movie again i would be forever grateful. thanks!",0

"question about ""the bells"" from virat pal hi everyone,

i recently watched the horror short movie ""the bells"" by virat pal.

often times movies get dissected on youtube with youtubers trying to interpret the story and come up with explainations for open questions.

does anyone have an idea what was going on here?

like: why are there bells playing just before the monster appears?

what was that bloodied thing wrapped in the towl the man finds halfway through?

or can his wife actually hear the bells too? after all she stops doing the dishes shortly when the bells ring for her son.

also: according to the credits the creature is played by eva holliday who is not credited on imdb for instance. could it be that the mother as well as the monster were played by the same person?

"which country produces the scariest horror movies (and ghosts)? hey guys, i live in singapore and recently i realised that my friends and i get most freaked out by a specific type of movie - thai/indonesian/japanese horror movies featuring vengeful women spirits, like shutter, kuntilanak &amp; the ring. the closest equivalents i could find outside of asia - the likes of midsommar &amp; carrie - were less scary to us. i'm trying to figure out why. maybe we get scared by stories that seem to hit closer to home. or maybe asian ghosts are just the scariest. ;)

so 2 questions for you - where do you live, and what sorts of ghost movies scare you the most?",0

"help, please! hi everyone, i was hoping you guys could help me find this movie i remember watching as a kid, but no matter how hard i look for it online i can't find it. i can only remember these things:

\-it involves 5 girls, who are put into cells by some of their friends.

\-they're on camera's and their names spell out d.e.a.t.h. 

\-it's based in an insane asylum with ghosts.",0

"can’t remember the name of the movie i watched a movie a while ago about these friends who went out to a cabin i believe and they had found some weird stuff before and then two friends were exploring around in a cave i think it was and they found one of the girls that was with them in the cave, but the “real girl” was back in the cabin and then they find the rest of their bodies in the cave dead.  they also found bloody writing outside the cave before entering and made a joke about it. the killer is basically one of the friends that stopped taking his medication and kinda lost it because they were kinda making fun of him and it basically ends with them trying to prevent the event from happening and so it ends up being one of the guys from the past who wrote in the rock to warn their future selfs and the loop continues until someone is able to break it, but until then the events will continue to happen. i don’t know if that makes sense, but it’s a pretty recent movie that was in netflix a while back, but i forgot the name of the movie, if anybody knows would you please let me know.",0
"the last drive-in/shudder i finally did it. i pulled the trigger on shudder.

something about the beginning of summer and half o ween gets me stoked for fall and, of course, halloween and all the horror movies.

as such, i have been digging up movies and content everywhere i could. 

i have a deep love for horror hosts, (i even have a svengoolie action figure), and given that hosted movies are so hard to find now i just kind of figured, fuck it. it's time to pull the trigger. i spend a lot more than 5 a month on things that are far more frivolous, and it's good to support anything horror related monetarily. 

joe bob is great like he always is, though this time he is far less restrained and unfiltered. that is overall a great thing, because cable type censorship in a horror movie just doesn't make sense to me, and the freedom lets joe speak his mind and use whatever language he wants.

now, that comes with a caveat, which is that joe  bob is a southerner and is very libertarian. often his views are moderate/conservative slanted and may not mesh well with everyone. think south park republican, and it'll give you the basic idea. joe tends to rant about political topics and sometimes his views are very... classical and borderline problematic in today's pc type culture. 

i myself tend to lean moderate/left. a place i like to call sensibly liberal. so often its hard to separate the character from the ideology. so if you're politically sensitive, joe bob may not be for you. he's kind of like the cool uncle who gave you your first beer and taught you how to shoot a bb gun when you were 12, but uses words that your principle would hate.

all that said, he's incredibly smart and knowledgeable about horror and knows about the craft of film making. 

if you can separate your ideology from the character and enjoy the show for the sake of horror entertainment, then god damn it's amazing. 

shudder is also worth it. the movie selection is great and they tend to carry the type of movies that i've always wanted to watch but are hard to find. some of the obscure titles are only really able to be found on shudder. 

creepshow deserves a special shout out too. horror anthology is probably my favorite kind of show or movie, and this is one of the best.

anyway, if you're in the fence and aren't sure about the price, sign up for the free trial and see of its worth it for you.

so far for me, it's absolutely worth it.",0

"did john carpenter rip off from dario argento? i was just causing controversy in the title, but actually i'm kinda curious if any of you guys know if carpenter inspired himself on argento's profondo rosso to make halloween. 

after watching profondo rosso i noticed a lot of similarities between it and halloween. there's this scene with the killer and the victim and the victim holds onto a knitting needle much like laurie does before she faces michael almost at the end. i also noticed the theme songs of both movies are quite similar.

i don't think i'm imagining things, so i just wanna know what you guys think or if there's actually a source for these similarities.",0

"what is the name of this horror movie that freaked me out when i watched it on chiller when i was a kid? 
so i remember this scene where two woman are like tied up vertically in this room.  a random dude is tied up to a table horizontally until another guy comes in a releases him.  when he does that, the tied up man jumps off the table and shuffles over to this black woman and pretty much eats part of her abdomen and she dies.  i also remember a scene where the dude who ate part of the woman turns normal again and like chops a zombie in half from the shoulder down.  i kinda remember this movie taking place in some sort of asylum or hospital but i could be wrong.  the guy had sort of long hair if that helps.  anyway, this movie freaked me the fuck out as a kid and haven’t seen it pop up anywhere since.",0

summer horror movies does anyone know some good horror movies with summer vibes?,0
"what's the name of his weird horror movie? it takes place in the woods with a group of friends who are all under the impression they're on ""vacation"". they all eventually realize they are fucked, after, one-by-one, being attacked by the killer, who appears as a red, digital simulation...and has the ability to shift in and out of the physical plane.... 

the girl(who is part of the clique) later admits she led them there, &amp; used them all as bait to catch the killer. she explains how she went on the same trip years ago with her old group of friends and everyone ended up dead except for her. no one believed her/everyone thought she was crazy because they never found the killer, or any of her friends' bodies. 

the weirdest part of this movie is the killer. 
he is literally a red digital image. he's like static....if you try to touch him, you'd just pass through. somehow he is able to hurt you though....and this girl figures out how to catch him. and she does. she boobie traps a place between two trees which acts as the entrance to some sort of ""portal"" from the world he enters through to come to our physical world....she also figured out how to hurt him....he ends up getting away, wounded, and everyone else, including the girl, all die.

 it's a weird, b horror movie that does a good job at staying with you for days. 
any answers would be greatly appreciated!",0

"concerning a recent post about ""unstable moderation"" i'm making this thread for the sake of clarity.

i am the one single mod that exists here now, since i seem to have trouble holding on to a co-mod. reasons for this vary, but is typically their choice. 

so, i get a random message today to my inbox, it essentially said ""hey, i run a series of other subreddits, and am interested in this one. if you ever get bored of it let me know.""

essentially he was asking to take over the sub.

so, i responded, saying i've spent years building this place and am going to keep it, and it won't leave my grasp unless reddit admins force it on me.

at which time he sends me a message saying ""chill"".

so i block him and move on with life, at which time i check the sub about an hour later and saw the post made here.

all that said, if you ever feel like i don't run things here fairly or stably, please let me know. the only time i've been accused of unfair conduct is by people who have their threads removed for violating rules. 

so, yeah. im sure nobody cares anyway, but i wanted to let everyone know what that was about for the sake of clarity.


update: in retaliation i've been getting banned from some random horror related subreddits that i've never posted in or visited during my 10 years of being on reddit. 

how hilariously petty.

it started with a couple that had a car accident and the boyfriend was very injured but the girl was fine, so when the ambulance arrived they only took the boy to the hospital but they never told his girlfriend which hospital they were taking him to, then a taxi driver offered himself to help her find the hospital but turned out he worked at the hospital and it was a trap to take her there; later she discovers that the hospital was burned down a long time ago and everybody inside died horribly, i don't remember the end pretty well but i think that she died in the car accident since the beginning and the boyfriend survived and the hospital and everything was like a purgatory r something like that. sorry if my english is not too good, i tried my best.",0
"dragula netflix series. what a weird fucking show. 

if john waters made a reality show and mixed in equal parts face off and drag race, this would be the result.

it's hard to watch sometimes, it's embarrassing and weird and gross and cringy as fuck, also it feels really low budget for what it is. 

all that aside, its also got some of the best and creepiest characters and makeup effects i've ever seen.

if you take the sfx makeup on face off, and dial it up to 20, this is what you would get.

the queens all tend to be dramatic and catty and a lot of the infighting gets shown, which is annoying to me because i don't give a shit about any of it. so, you may need to fast forward past that. 

regardless of your personal feelings on their lifestyle, this show is worth watching for some of the unsettling characters and makeup.",0

"replacing the exorcist 2... so after the sacrifice of fathers merton and karras in the exorcist just so the innocent reagan could have a real life, warner bros followed up this 1973 masterpiece with what was essentially a low budget cash grab! 

fundamentally, exorcist ii: the heretic is gutter trash. it was considered one of the worst films ever made at the time, and watching it today is still more comedic that atmospheric. it’s just such a poor excuse of a follow up to the intense story of despair and sacrifice that was the original.

everytime i look for it on google i get videodrome. which is not what i'm looking for btw. but it does have a scene that looks similar to what i'm looking for. the scene were the guy shoves his head inside the tv.

"psycho 2 i know it's sacrilege, but i prefer this movie to the original by hitchcock.

now, don't get me wrong, i love the original and its one of the most important movies in horror history and culture. i am also a fan of hitchcock and his work.

now, all that said, if given the choice i would watch this over the first one.

this film stands as one of the most twisted mindfucks in psychological horror history. norman is a sympathetic character, and you genuinely root for him to be successful against all odds. this and breaking bad are successful at setting up the lead as a questionable character and having you be sympathetic for them and hope for their victory.

meg tilly, who i much prefer to her sister, robert loggia and of course anthony perkins all give fantastic performances. perkins has this amazing stare that looks unsettled and is very distractingly creepy and plays his role of mental instability better than anyone else i've seen, besides for maybe joaquin phoenix or brad douriff.

the guy who plays the sheriff deserves special attention as well. he feels like a sheriff from a comedic sitcom, but it somehow works, and his scenes are probably my favorites in the movie.

midsommar i think this movie is a hit or miss. i truly loved it! the director has interesting ways to go about presenting scenes and creating an uncomfortable eerie feeling when watching. he definitely has a style of horror movies as he has also directed hereditary which was just as eerie and twisted. i have met a couple people who did not like this movie at all which i understand because it is a bit triggering. but i loved the story and i felt like it had a great hint of humor along with it. definitely different than most movies but i’d definitely recommend! is there anyone that’s seen this movie and feels the same or didn’t like it?,0

"movies similar to the den or poughkeepsie tapes? i really enjoy the way these movies follow a plot without paranormal things occurring and exhibiting true fear because the events are possible in real life. the den is about a girl who finds herself as a victim to a dark web website that monetizes the death of someone and footage recorded from their laptop screen leading up to their death. does anyone know of a movie with similar traits, not exactly a found footage movie, but something that explores real world topics or threats, something that makes you think ""could that happen to me one day"" after watching it? thanks",0

it was something with some sort of lagoon/creek/lake monster/girl/idek, i know it had to have had one of those words in the title. it was probably made somewhere in the 2000's to 2010's because it was early 2010's that she had it. it definitely is not a popular one and is probably pretty shitty, seeing as i can't find it anywhere on the internet.

"brahms: the boy 2 i loved the first film, it was very unique and was good at building suspense and making you ask questions.

now on the flipside, this one does not.

it feels like a run of the mill spooky doll movie and doesn't really do anything to make it interesting. 

1 did something i liked, which created an atmosphere that makes you think you're watching a supernatural cliche, and flips it over to something thats possible and logical. 

this one does the opposite. it makes you think you're watching a continuation of the first movie and makes you assume that that same non supernatural twist is there, but the twists it into something supernatural. 

it went from a psychological horror to a cheesy supernatural annabell knock off.

well made, well acted, well shot, but the story stinks and it lost the surprise factor and spirit of part 1.

"vivarium i'm gonna keep this one short, because its a difficult one to talk about.

what i was hoping for was a movie about a weird suburb. what i got felt like an extended episode of outer limits wrapped in a not subtle metaphor about suburban life.

thats not generally a bad thing, i actually quite like the outer limits. this one however started to feel flat and kind of told the same story over and over. this kid is weird and something isn't right, over and over for about 40 minutes. there were also a lot of story beats and things that happen that didn't seem to have any effect on the story, it was just swept under a rug and forgotten about for the conclusion. 

honestly, you could cut out 30 minutes of redundant story and it would make one hell of an episode of twilight zone or outer limits.

beyond that, it was ok. certainly well made, though some parts looked so fake it looked like toy story esque cg, which i still think it may have been.

regardless, 6/10. an interesting semi intellectual watch that isn't nearly as smart as it wanted to be.",0
"the hunt 2020 if you want to watch and get surprised by this movie, then get out now.

this movie was weird.

i didnt feel like it really knew what it wanted to be.

i went into it hoping for a survival centric horror type film, or even a good action thriller type film like surviving the game, but what i got was more of a politically heated caricature of our left and right parties.

the violence and death was all well done and realistic... mostly.

the acting was surprisingly good as well. and it was well made, which is something jason blum excels at on smaller budgets.

one of the positives for me was the unpredictably of it. every time i thought we were watching the ""lead character"" they would die in horrific ways.

first was yoga pants, and then attractive buff guy, and then ethan suplee, and they all died quickly in horrific ways not too long after they took center stage. 

it turns out, the lead character would be the smart girl we saw making the compass from a leaf and a needle in the beginning. they hinted to her being competent early on before actually getting her in the lead.

i also enjoyed the not so subliminal swipes they took at both sides of the party line. the self hating white people, the too sensitive pc types, and the crazy conspiracy theorists and gun lovers and racists on the right. without getting too biased, i think this was a well done parody and commentary on the extremes of both sides. 

on the downside, hillary swank was a tough sell as the ""final boss"" type of the movie, and the movie lost its tone the moment our ""hero"" stepped into the manor. the final fight scene felt too choreographed and like it belonged more in a jackie chan movie than in a movie that had, up until this point, had a grounded and realistic depiction of violence and death. it went from gritty and real to looney tunes almost immediately. 

from there the message was lost, the tone was lost and everything just kind of went to shit.

also, i'm not sure what genre it was trying to be. it was funny, but not a comedy, gorey, but not a horror movie, tense, but not a thriller, and political, but not a political movie. action/thriller/horror/comedy/political is a weird combination, and there was potential for any of them to work, but none of them were substantial enough to successfully create the overarching genre. 

besides all that, it was entertaining until the end portion, and sometimes that's all it needs to be.

what are some other horror films that don't have any kills? i can't imagine there'd be any other slashers that would fit the mold, but perhaps there's some ghost movies or sci-fi horrors that i can't think of. its impressive to me if anyone can do a solid horror with nobody dying.",0

they don't make horror movies like this anymore.  maybe it's just my personal taste in movies, but i think this film is what makes scary movies so great.  this movie proves that you can be cheesy and scary, something i feel is really lacking from the horror movies we see today that take themselves far too seriously (i'm looking at you, a24 films).  overall, i give this movie an 8.5/10, and i will definitely be looking to watch the sequels sometime in the future.",0

"""the addiction"" 1995. god and mankind laid bare for your inspection. having just watched ""the addiction"".
i find myself compelled to offer some thoughts.

submitted to you in b&amp;w, it will force you to look deeply at the subject and the characters. rather than garish colors that prevent one from facing the nature of the films questions.

here there is film that encapsulates the deepest, darkest philosophies of mankind.

stated eloquently by christopher walken.

“mankind has striven to exist beyond good and evil, from the beginning. and you know what they found? me.”

lili taylor's performance was deeply introspective.
her struggle with looking inside herself, at the very nature of humanities penchant for darkness and violence.
forces one to search within oneself for that very touch of evil we hold at bay.

""we aren't evil because we do evil.
we do evil because we are evil.""

christopher walken, while having a small role nonetheless becomes pivotal in taylor's divestment of the last stains of humanity within herself.

i could continue to expatiate upon this film, however i would recommend you view it with no expectations and open mind about this film.

what are your thoughts?",0
"scary movie from my youth (25 years ago) when i was about 6 years old i accidentally watched a horror movie (or maybe it was just a scene from a show?) which changed my life. after watching it i never slept without covering my face with my blanket and i'm still suspicous when i'm in a dark room. to overcome this - not too traumatising - trauma, i want to watch it again, just to see that it wasn't as scary as i remember it to be.

the big problem is i have no clue which movie it is and i only saw a couple of minutes of it. so, it is kind of a long shot, but i'll just try, hoping someone can identify the movie for me.
 
i saw the movie about 25 years ago, so it's pretty old. the movie was about men, some sort of zombies/monsters, who come out of a lake during the night. there was a family living close to the lake, or maybe they were on holiday, and they had two young children (a boy and a girl, as i recall). the girl got into a fight with her parents, or brother, and decided to sleep outside in a hammock, instead of the bunkbeds with her brother (dumb idea). while sleeping outside, those men came out of the lake, walked up to her and stood there above her head. being wet, one of the men dripped on her, waking her up and scaring the living crap out of her (as predicted).

"underwater would have been the best of the ""deep sea alien"" clones if it had come out in 1989. i just watched underwater and it was better than i expected. yes, it's ""underwater alien"" and doesn't try to be anything more than that, but overall it was fine. and compared to most movies released to theatres in january, it's damn good.

underwater is set on a drilling station on the bottom of the marianas trench in the pacific ocean, and after a disaster destroys the facility, a few people have to try and survive. but there's something else down there with them. 

the marianas trench is the deepest place in the world with a depth of over 36,000 feet; by comparison, mount everest is 29,000 feet high. it would be impossible for humans to survive that far down, but there are numerous scenes of people walking around on the ocean floor. at one point, a couple of characters even run across the bottom. i'm not an expert on the topic, but i don't think that would be possible. 

if you can overlook that (and kristen stewart's unchanging facial expression), underwater isn't bad. it's not really scary, but there are a couple of good shock scenes are other parts manage to generate a bit of suspense. the ""monster"" is hidden throughout most of the first half of the movie, seen mostly in quick glimpses, but looks good when shown more clearly in the second half. it's cgi, but at least one scene uses a pretty good practical model.

underwater was completed in 2017, but was put on a shelf after disney bought 20th century fox and wasn't released until this year. it deserved a better fate than being an expensive dtv movie. worth watching if/when it shows up on netflix, or when it's sitting in a $10 clear-out bin.

i'd give underwater a **7/10.**",0

hereditary 
midsommar

"halloween 3: season of the witch (1982) just got done watching the third installment of the halloween series and i gotta say its pretty good.  i know this movie divides fans of the halloween franchise but honestly its done pretty well and with a cool concept.  the whole thing felt like a twilight zone episode with some cool, subtle nods to the previous 2 films.  it's a shame that this movie got so much hate, because its very creative and it probably would have increased the longevity of the halloween franchise if people hadnt complained about it so much.

i watched it probably two years ago on netflix, it’s a recent movie (probably from the late 2000s?), it’s not the ruins. it was a group of friends on vacation in the jungle, they meet some local girl who takes them into the jungle to hike and explore.  she goes to make out with one of the guys in a river and i think maybe someone goes missing?  or they see something creepy?  i can’t remember.  they have to stay in the jungle overnight. eventually they find some little cave with a weird creature in it (almost like from the descent) and at the end there are news crews reporting it all.

"what is your favorite zombie outbreak opening (movie, tv, video game, book) and why? **(note: feedback is welcome, but i'd appreciate any/all discourse respecting each other's opinions and preferences. i will indulge no insults or comment wars.)**

&amp;#x200b;

2004's *dawn of the dead* remake has what is in my opinion the greatest intro to a zombie outbreak. watching for the first time as a kid (i fully admit to probable nostalgic bias), it felt almost plausible.

&amp;#x200b;

the footage used, while only showing most clips onscreen for a couple-few seconds, was so gritty, chaotic, unapologetically gruesome at points, and masterfully edited to convey society's collapse.

&amp;#x200b;

mainly, because of the spliced together news footage. i hear many complaints on how *""lazy""* it is to edit random clips together, but, to be fair, you could say the same about countless examples in media.

&amp;#x200b;

it's a trope, sure, but it works. it doesn't have to be 100% realistic, and piecing existing footage together often makes more practical sense than spending time &amp; money on entirely fictitious clips.

&amp;#x200b;

in fact, i'd argue that using pre-existing clips can actually be more effective since your mind may unconsciously remember certain clips from a real story you saw once (it all goes by so fast).

&amp;#x200b;

thus, even if you don't consciously take the time to figure out where the clips originated, your unconscious mind could instinctively react in such a way that it associates reality with this fiction.

&amp;#x200b;

the bonus *""special report""* feature makes it even more enjoyable, if you watch that before starting the actual film back-to-back (as if that were the news ana &amp; luis missed during their date night).

&amp;#x200b;

i'm well aware of how cheesy it is by today's standards (the more real-life news i've watched, the faker this report looks in comparison), but the passion put into it helps maintain my enjoyment.

&amp;#x200b;

you can tell that the crew had fun putting it together. zack snyder's work ethic is similarly evident, as he set out to make the most of this concept and deliver the best zombie apocalypse film he could.

&amp;#x200b;

lastly, i love the use of johnny cash's *""when the man comes around""*. something about it just fits so well thematically and makes the whole intro eerier, like a swan song as the world goes to hell.

&amp;#x200b;

i think of this film whenever i hear it. sometimes, you hear a tune and think *""this is too good of a match for the experience to waste""*, like how *""i don't want to set the world on fire""* fits the *fallout* series.

"which major horror franchise saw the biggest dip in quality over its course? was thinking about this the other day.  all horror franchise seem to drop steep in quality after the 2nd, 3rd, or 4th installments, i.e  friday the 13th and the major slasher series.  i was wondering what franchise yall think took the worst dip in quality when compared to the original?  my vote is hellraiser, i thoroughly enjoyed the first two and consider them classics, but almost right after that it turned into direct-to-dvd garbage.",0
"horror movie help!!!! i have been racking my brain trying to figure out the name of this movie. this may be a tough one but i'm hoping someone can figure it out for me.

at the end there's a chair sitting in the middle of a circle of mirrors and i think they were trying to draw out demons from inside a woman.

this was probably about 5-8 years ago i watched this.

"follow up on us horror film (my thoughts) like many of you said, the concept was interesting but also a mess of a movie(?)... i stopped watching it halfway (around the scene when the black family runs for help to the white family’s house only to find out the white family has been murdered as well by their lookalikes etc) 

i really wanted to keep trying on completing the movie and giving it a chance but i simply got bored of it and didn’t even find it scary lol. rotten tomatoes is crazy for rating it the number 1 horror movie... lol

"cabin in the woods review- no spoilers hey i’m back with another review haha. i recently watched cabin in the woods and decided to give a review. this movie is on hulu. i’m rating based on four things: plot, scare factor, acting, and my overall rating. 

synopsis: when five college friends (kristen connolly, chris hemsworth, anna hutchison, fran kranz, jesse williams) arrive at a remote forest cabin for a little vacation, little do they expect the horrors that await them. one by one, the youths fall victim to backwoods zombies, but there is another factor at play. two scientists (richard jenkins, bradley whitford) are manipulating the ghoulish goings-on, but even as the body count rises, there is yet more at work than meets the eye.

plot: 7/10
the plot was for the most part clear and to the point. it was easy to understand and there were some nice twists and turns. it however was very fast paced. it was hard to really get to know the characters. some parts were kind of confusing and needed more clarification.

scare factor: 6/10
there were quite a few jump scares and the movie was kind of gory. there also were quite a few scare elements/characters, that are seen in most horror movies.

acting: 8/10
the acting was good. you understood the relationships between characters and how they all fit together. i would say the best acting really came from the scientists not the actual teens. one thing i wasn’t a big fan of was the over exaggeration of the character types. it kind of made the movie seem like it was being dumbed down so you understood who played what type of role.

overall: 7/10 
i personally thought it was a good movie. i really liked the concept of the plot and some of the scares. however, i did think the plot was a little too fast, and the teen characters were kind of bleh. with that in mind though i would recommend this movie. it was fun to watch and has a really cool concept behind it.",0

"can’t find this movie :/ so i need help figuring out what this movie was called! i remember the plot, albeit not too well, but just can’t find the name anywhere 

lady movies into a new apartment building and starts getting creepy calls on her phone (both on a cell and i believe a black rotary phone?) from an older woman, that get more and more intense and at one point it starts even hurting the girl (at one point the woman even pours boiling water over a little girl that affects our main girl?)

she also has interactions with other people living  in the building, one of which being the main one between her and a man who does work around the building. 

towards the end there’s a whole lot of bodies in the wall type mess?? 

the title of the movie itself has the words “call” and “stranger” i believe! it used to be on netflix for a while and is from the 2000s.

"hollowman was not how i remember it so when i was a kid my whole family would go to my grandmas every sunday, that seven aunts, and uncle and all there kids along with myself. now most of the time the adult would stay in a watch and movie and the kids would play outside. i didnt want to play outside that day and one of my aunt brought over the movie hollowman. now i dont remember how old i was but now as a 25 year old i remembered the movies plot being good, i didnt remember the finer details of the movie....namely the violence, i simply remembered science trying to make people invisible.

holy crap this movie is freaking violent, the rape scene and.....something i actually repressed as a child apparently. i was watching with my bf and some friends, we'd seen the invisible man recently and figured why not. the scene was coming up with the invisble guy is mad at this dog that wont stop barking. now.....leading up to the scene i couldnt remember....i thought he strangled the dog....that's how i remember it......and for those who have seen hollowman.....that's not at all what he does to the dog.

at the end of the scene i was shook because again....i must have repressed this as a kid because i was not at all expecting what happened. everyone looked at me a little confused because id stated that id seen the movie before

"can anyone help me identifying a movie 

i saw an italian horror last year but can’t remember its name.

it concerns a pregnant woman who’s perused by a satanic cult. apparently she’s to give birth to the antichrist.

at that point she comes to terms with the whole thing!

anyway i believe that afterwards the baby (who is satan/anti-christ) takes over the world. 

the film is possibly italian?

"why is the fright night (1985) score so damn good? ok, so there are two things i must first take into consideration: 
1. when this movie was released, i was only four years old, and at such an early age, ""scary"" can take on an entirely different psychological dynamic that sticks with you for the rest of your life.
2. i am a musician (self-taught, so i am not 100% fluent in the language of music), and i have always been very in-tune to the way a film score can make me feel something intense, surreal, and new, deep in my being (""surreal"" being the word to focus on in that description).


maybe it's just me, but i feel like the score for the 1985 film fright night is one of the greatest, most emotionally  manipulative, perfectly fitting to each scene, couldn't be better type of score. (the 80's actually had several horror movies with epic scores like this)
while the many synthesized instruments used in the score definitely date the film in a big way, i think this is also a bigger positive than negative. it reminds the viewer that the story comes from a time when horror was at it's absolute peak. when people wanted more than anything to be terrified in the theater, and experience something unlike any generation before them. 
the 1980's was the decade made for horror! (back when freddy krueger was as big as today's lady gaga).
(edit: upon further consideration, i don't believe gaga is nearly as big as krueger was in his prime. i currently can't think of a present day equivalent. needless to say, freddy was every-fucking-where. i even had a freddy krueger yo-yo as a kid.)


the whole reason for this post is to discuss this music with you. i am interested in what other fright night fans think of the film's score. 

 i don't believe the film would've been nearly as memorable with a different score. 


what do you think/feel?

this specific score can actually invoke a feeling in my chest that i would imagine is similar to how i'd feel if i came face to face with a real vampire or evil creature. i believe this shows the true natural talent of the composer. he/she was able to take a fictional situation and the resulting emotion, and turn it into something tangible.

so why is samara's body found in the well underneath cabin 12 of the shelter mountain inn? noah said something along the lines of, ""they'll bury her next week,"" implying that the actual body of samara was found in that well. i didn't think shelter mountain was on moesko island, it certainly looks nothing like the morgan property any other time it is shown.

"level 16 - spoilers i just watched this last night. the movie is more of a creepy uncomfortable movie where you know something is wrong but you can’t put your finger on it. 

it’s about a ‘girls school’ in russia where girls are taught how to be perfect little ladies and are promised to be adopted eventually.  they’ve put in different levels, obviously, and they eat and sleep and go to class based on the hall where they live. they’re given ‘vitamins’ each day and have chores to do but they don’t go outside, being told that the air outside is poisonous. 

eventually two of the girls uncover the truth. the vitamins are made to drug the girls, and at night prospective ‘parents’ come while they’re asleep to choose the girl they want.  but they don’t want them as their daughter. they want them so the woman can have the girl’s face. since they’ve never been outside their skin is perfect.

i feel like i might have seen all the good ones:

dead alive

re-animator

the dead next door i seem to remember being like what i'm talking about.

return of the living dead 2 is delightfully gross.

fulci and the other italian gorefests are great but the carnage level doesn't seem to compare.  if you know any from that region that paint every wall red, please let me know.

day of the dead

and plenty more that slip my mind.  but only the first two have the level of gore i currently crave.  

much thanks, fright fiends!",0

"if you could direct a horror movie, what elements would it have? everyone has their ideas for a dream horror movie, one that they'd kill to direct themselves or see on the big screen. so why don't we talk about our perfect horror?

i would want a horror movie in the trenches of world war 1 (i know, death watch and trench 11 did it first). it would involve a group of both british and german soldiers are fighting for their lives both under and above ground. over time their hatred towards one another summons a monster or demon sent to end their destruction and malice. it could be the spirits of the countless fallen soldiers or the distress and anger the fighting soldiers felt towards the war brought in a physical form. one combining all the disgusting atrocities of the trenches - barbed wire wrapped around it, a gas mask that pours out mustard gas, swarms of rats, lice, and maggots crawling all around and on it, the ability to rot flesh with just a touch of its gangrenous fingers. in the end the germans and the british would have to work together to escape before it can complete its mission.

what horror movie would you love to direct or create? are there any movies that came so close to your dream synopsis, but just missed it by a few marks? or do you have that perfect horror movie that covers absolutely everything you would have ever wanted to see?",0

"case 39 review- no spoilers hey all! i recently watched case 39 and decided to give a review on it. this movie is on hulu.

synopsis: in her many years as a social worker, emily jenkins (renée zellweger) thinks she has seen it all -- until she meets 10-year-old lilith (jodelle ferland) and the girl's cruel parents. when the parents try to harm the child, emily assumes custody of lilith while looking for a foster family. however, she soon finds that dark forces surround the seemingly innocent child, and the more she tries to protect lilith, the more horrors she encounters.

i’m going to do different categories to rate this movie. scary, plot, acting, and overall rating.

scary factor: 4/10 
this movie wasn’t really that scary. there weren’t really any jump scares, maybe 1 or 2. the movie just gave you an overall creepy feeling. as many horror movies involving children can be.

plot: 8/10
the plot was really well rounded and you understood each characters relationship with the other. at time though the movie seemed to drag a little bit and repeated somethings. other than that though the plot was really good.

acting: 10/10 
the acting in this movie was really good. especially for the main character and the little girl. they brought a real emotions and fear into the movie. it was very well acted. 

overall: 7.5/10
i really enjoyed watching this movie. though it wasn’t really scary it did still give me a rush of adrenaline at some parts. i would recommend watching this movie.",0

"non gore &amp; non supernatural horror film suggestion hi all,

i am a horror movie fan, would like your suggestion of such films without gore or any ghost. or with mild blood. 

i like films that is frightening at personal level and that is based on trauma, movies that haunts you for long time. 

in my experience, true horror films are rare. i mean movies that really don't rely on jump scares but slow burning tension.

recently i saw i am the pretty thing that lived in the house. in spite of slow pace and lot of criticism, i really liked it. 

 let's not discuss about popular one such as babadook, hereditary, the witch, the shining and it follows.

i am talking more about films that has blend of horror and psychological such the vanishing, dog tooth, the killing of sacred deer, the invitation, the innocents 

you know kind of films where you sense that something is wrong but you don't know what it is. the horror comes from human rather than unknown entity. 

which films really makes you disturbed? if so, what sort of elements were unique in those films? 

for me, the vanishing was such film. won't spoil anything but it is a must watch. 

thank you.",0

"daughter of dracula 1936 i caught this recently being hosted by svengoolie, and as much as i love horror, i'm not the best fan since i'm not as familiar with the old hammer films as i should be. i've seen the basics, but that's about it, the offshoots and sequels like this one are pretty obscure to me.

anyway, usually i watch sven for sven and tune out most of the movies, but once in a while you find a gem that makes the entire experience a joy.

so this film may be about a character who is a vampire, and has all of the old timey vampire characteristics, but in this case it's about more. 

it's not just the character killing people and the police struggling to find the solution as many of the old hammer films tend to be, but its also the struggle of the character. she has a lot of humanity to her in her struggle to resist her compulsion to feed on blood. she is a genuinely good person(?) with a genuinely bad habit. it reminds me of the monsters from  the fly or ginger snaps, how the film is more about the characters and their internal struggles than it is about the horror or killing. this is an unexpected amount of depth and character growth for one of these old low budget hammer films.

all that said, it's also dated and has a lot of old timey sexism in it. a lot of old movies stand as a testament to how much our social culture has changed.

there was also a lot of lesbian undertones in the film and its heavily implied that the lead character is indeed a lesbian. incredibly racy and progressive for something from the mid 30s.

gloria holden does a fantastic job of shining through with an amazing performance, despite the old timey fast talking dialogue and the sound quality that sounds like it was recorded with a tin can tied to a string.

anyway, a good watch if you have the time, which i'm assuming most of us do right now.

thanks svengoolie for introducing me to another fantastic film.",0

"finally got to watch the taking of deborah logan i’m a big found footage fan and this is one that gets brought up a lot so i’ve wanted to see it for a while now. unfortunately i haven’t been able to find it anywhere but it was recently added to tubi so i was able to watch it today. i just got done watching it a minute or two ago as i’m writing this so you’re getting my unedited initial thoughts. 

overall, i thought it was really well-done, creepy and has something that other found footage filmmakers can learn from because it makes sure to properly set up its story and characters firstly. too many found footage films just throw you into a situation with characters that you don’t care about and thus a movie that suffers from a lack of tension. with this film, though, the small cast allows for most of them to be fully developed and for the audience to get to know them. 

the script also really delves into the tragic drama of alzheimer’s and how it affects those involved so you’re invested before things even get creepy. and they really do get creepy. a lot of this is owed to jill larson who plays the titular role. she really throws herself into this and makes her performance very believable while also being very eerie when things start going demonic. 

there is one main problem, though. while i said previously that it’s a great example of found footage done right, the third act does feature a fair bit of shaky cam, wacky sound effects, and other tired found footage cliches. it doesn’t detract too much from the tense climax because the script is so compelling, but they do elicit a bit of a sigh at the fact that such an intelligent and well-constructed film stoops to a lower level like that. 

a more minor negative is that a twist in the final shot does feel a bit tacked on and unnessecary. it doesn’t ruin a good ending, and in fairness the realization of what has happened is fairly creepy, but i think it maybe should’ve been cut to make the ending a bit neater. overall, though, this one was worth the hype and i’m glad i finally found it somewhere. highly recommended if you enjoy found footage.",0

"what is “ju-on”? the whole concept behind it is hard to understand. i mean, popular culture, especially east asian (and southeast asian) horror films, portray these ghostly figures as more like demonic forces literally straight out of the pits from hell driven by only one goal: kill. but then, people insist that these are not demons but are spirits of the dead. however, as said before, the way they’re portrayed in the films delves far away from the traditional western concept of a spirit of a deceased person trapped in limbo and more dangerously closer to the western notion of a demonic force at work—like a literal, virtually unstoppable, uncontainable essence of evil that threatens the very sanity, health, prosperity and existence of mankind.

so what is an onryou exactly? are they really just vengeful spirits (in the truest sense of the word) of deceased people unjustly murdered in life? could they be tormented souls seeking (or wanting) desperately to break free of what is a cycle of an earth-bound hell in an ongoing loop of bloodshed and horror ad infinitum? could they be forced to live and re-live the final wretched moments of their lives seconds before their deaths in scenarios akin to a tape recording that just plays and replays itself over and over? what exactly causes this to happen? could these earthbound souls themselves be under the influence (or even worse, the control) of demonic forces at work? could some powerful demonic deity/chieftain be at the helm of all of this reign of terror? or, could it be the spirit world’s way of “shedding away” all of the impurities that makes the world of the living such an unwelcoming place to live in in the first place? could it be the metaphysical equivalent to, as often portrayed in science fiction media, nature's way of “dumping” all of the trash that’s on earth, so that the world can be restored to what it once was and should be? considering the apparently unstoppable, unending and unconquerable nature of these types of curses, it makes you wonder why that is. perhaps “ju-on” may not be so evil after all and may have some underlying well-intentioned motive behind it.",0
"my thoughts on the original night of the living dead before i begin, in case anyone is like me and hasn’t seen this, or in case you just want a good way to access the film, it’s available for free on tubi in both a black and white and colorized version. now that the psa’s done, onto the review. 

i’ve been a horror fan for a number of years now and have seen many of the classics as well as many zombie films. despite this however, george a. romero’s “of the dead” series is something that i never seemed to get around to. after noticing that this original film was available for free on tubi, i decided i should finally watch what is considered one of the best horror films ever made and the catalyst for the zombie subgenre. having seen the film, i must say, i liked it. did i love it? no. is it particularly scary? not in my opinion. but it does have a lot of things going for it and i can see why it’s so revered, as it is one of a kind, even today. 

to get my main negative out of the way first, i do feel the film is rather cheesy by today’s standards. the antagonists aren’t particularly frightening and the acting and music are sometimes hokey. that’s the only big issue i have, really. other than that, it’s a pretty entertaining and engrossing zombie film. the characters are interesting, it’s intense at points, and it has a unique vibe due to the low budget that works in its favor. during the first half, it seemed as though it would essentially be a two person piece and i was worried it would become boring if barbra remained catatonic the whole time. i was already getting a bit fatigued with the idea of this by the end of the first act. luckily though, the film soon introduces several new characters that liven up the proceedings and ensure that dullness doesn’t settle in. overall, i feel it’s a very interesting novelty that every horror fan should see at least once, but i don’t think it’s one of the best horror films ever made as some have claimed. 

moving away from the review proper, i’d like to ask you folks some questions surrounding this film and the ensuing franchise. first, when i realized i was faced with the decision of watching the film in color or black and white, i ended up choosing color. although i generally prefer color when available, i don’t think it really added nor subtracted anything in this particular case. this isn’t to say i don’t care for black and white films. i loved the original psycho, for example. that being said, i’m not against colorization, either. if they released a color version of psycho, i’d at least try watching it just to see how it goes. but if they never do, i’m perfectly content watching it in black and white. what do you think? do you think this film works better as a color film and what are your thoughts on colorization in general? 

second, now that i’ve watched this film, i’m currently planning out my path through the related films. this includes romero’s own subsequent films, the 1990 remake, and the separate return of the living dead series. what are your thoughts on all these movies and what should i expect from them? also, considering dawn of the dead in particular, it appears that there are several versions of the film. which should i watch? right now i’m thinking the original 127 minute theatrical cut as it seems to be romero’s preferred version and the thought of a two and a half hour zombie film doesn’t really appeal to me. should i reconsider? 

thanks to anyone who read this far and i’d be happy to hear your thoughts on any of this.",0
"does anybody know what movie this is? i'm trying to find a movie i watched on netflix way back in early high school, so like around maybe 7 years ago. it was about ""the most haunted house in america"" and it was kind of the whole typical group of 20 somethings sneaking into the house at night. either everyone died in the end or maybe the one girl lived, i kinda forget. the one scene i explicitly remember was toward the end when (i think) the last surviving guy ended up sticking his hand into a hole in the wall or something and his arm ended up getting totally mauled, and then something made him die, i think he got dragged into the hole in the wall or something like that. i think the house was one of those places that people were able to tour during the day, and maybe one of the girls in the movie worked there or something? i had never heard of this movie before i watched it and i've never seen it anywhere after i watched it. thanks if you can help me find it :)",0

"well implemented and earlier teased (off-screen) element like in the autopsy of jane doe? hi guys,

i was wondering about the following:

spoilers ahead!

so in the movie the autopsy of jane doe, which was a movie i had watched back then when it was released and was now reminded of again, there is this song constanly playing in the radio where they sing 'open up your heart and let the sun shine in'. back then i was lucky enough that i payed close attention to the song while watching the movie and that i watched it (after a recommendation) in english and not in my native language (or otherwise the twist might have been lost).

when later in the movie one of the main characters thinks he is finally free he can hear the off-screen voice of the policeman outside who says that he needs to open up the door. and he then tells him to 'open up ... open up your heart and let the sun shine in'.

which was extremely creepy in that instance because you were prepared for it by the radio song and you knew that him starting to sing that song could only mean that everything is just an illusion.

back then it reminded me of the elevator scene in grave encounters 2, where you really thought they have escaped and then you get this cut as the door opens and they are back in the basement, or in 1408 when they tear down the post office.

now i'm wondering, are there other movies like that, that feature something that is teased before or that is known enough that you realize that something is wrong. like a policeman starting to sing in a creepy scene and you know this cannot be a good sign? i'm looking for these supernatural, ghost type movies and perhaps something related to this scene mentioned above. where you think you know the person on the other side of the door or in the dark and then it's not a jump scare but it's rather something like that, they talk in a new voice, they sing, they kinda strech the scene longer for you and give you this weird feeling.

feel free to spoiler me if necessary in this case.

and i'd be happy for any answer.

&amp;#x200b;

edit: other two scenes that came into my mind where the innkeepers where one person is in bed and you suddenly see that bride appear on screen. the scene was very long and lacked a real jump scare what made it even harder to watch and of course in sinister when he is walking around the house at night and the kids are standing behind him.

help me find the movie title i have been looking for this movie where a girl was killed and buried between a wall by her killer. her hair still grows after she was killed and buried. i dont remember who the actors were. i've been searching the internet for over a year trying to find this movie. do you think you guys can help me out? i appreciate you guys. thank you!,0
movie recommendations i’m 14 and have liked horror my whole life but in the last year and a half i have started becoming a real fan. i have made it through almost every major slasher franchise as those are by far my favorites. i was wondering if anyone has any movies i probably haven’t watched or heard of that i should check out. or also just some classics that would help me understand where the genre came from or understand its roots.,0
"help identifying horror movie from late 90s i was hoping someone on this sub can help. i’m 95% sure this was something i really saw, but can’t be sure because i was young. i distinctly remember running out of the room and to my parents in the kitchen after freaking the f*** out.

i can’t remember too much, but the movie opened with a scene of essentially a woman of running through a house where the walls were grabbing at her from both sides (almost in an ooze shape?) and there was possibly an old woman cackling in the room that she tried to hide in (i think).

was on tv in the us in the late 90s or even as late as 2001.

i’m so sorry for the horrible description, this 
memory just pops into my head every so often and i would love to know the origin.

thank you in advance, potential gold to winner!",0

"helping a friend figure out a movie they remember my friend messaged me trying to figure out the name of a movie they watched about 20 years ago and it sounds interesting, but nothing i can identify:

hey there!

""i saw it back in the 90s and the plot was about these people to seemed to live in tree houses. they never left, but interacted by internet.  at the end of it there was some unseen monster that came and killed them all... i remember it had a lot of green light, like a dos based computer system or their web images were black and green.""

"black mountain side, a true hidden gem this movie was really well done and captures the hopelessness of working and living alone in the wilderness. just by looking at it i could tell it was a low budget film, and as most of us know low budget films can produce the best results. on top of that it's a canadian film, and it really made me reflect upon my own work in the deep woods of north ontario so it got bonus points for that from me.

i won't go into too much detail to avoid spoiling the film, but their main quote on the front box gives you all you need to know: ""a creepy love letter to john carpenter's the thing"". it wasn't a rip off by any means and actually gave me more of a feeling of hopelessness and despair than the thing. it's a very well put together film and i highly recommend it.

\*\*spoilers below\*\*

i don't think i'll ever understand the ending though. from talk of cephalopod parasites to the motives of the deer god there really is a lot that can't be decoded. heck, the artifacts they found aren't even really shown on screen. however, this isn't exactly a bad thing at all in my opinion. the  omniscience and malice of the creature makes it all the more eerie, and its infinite knowledge makes me feel as if i'm not meant to ever understand its true intentions. on top of this, not showing the artifact inscriptions means that people can't research the designs on their own time to come to the conclusion that they're fake (but of course they are, it's only a movie). i feel this isn't a movie meant to be picked together and fully decoded, and it's nice to finally see a movie that doesn't desperately pull at strings or add non sensical filler to answer every single question.",0
"thirteen terrors (netflix series) this is an odd one.

its a thai horror anthology show that centers mainly around teenagers. it's got a lot of spooky ghosts and ouija type stuff thats typical of horror, so in my opinion it doesn't really break new ground, but the thai culture aspect of it made it interesting to me.

there's a lot of cheese and really predictable stories and some moments of horrible acting that bog it down, but it's entertaining nonetheless.

think of it like are you afraid of the dark, but gory and more adult.

anyway, it's not great, but it's a fun watch, and sometimes thats all it has to be.",0
"tryna find a zombie movie so i was a pussy as a kid and i used to watch movies with my dad and brother from redbox every friday/saturday
and one time there was a preview for a zombie movie i wasn't aware it was a zombie movie based on the begging but the preview started out like this...
nice happy suburban saturday morning vibes. dad's downstairs with wife i think there's maybe two little kids like elementary school age eating or drawing.
mom's cooking
the dad goes upstairs to wake up his teenage daugher and he's like good morning beautiful breakfast or soemthing and all this golden sunlight is shining through the thin curtains. and she was likw yawing/stretching okay. then my memory is a littke blurry byt like literally a horde of zombies just come(this is all memory so might not literally be a horde) but i got scared and closed my eyes most of it but i remeber i think the mom was in a closet like thing with the kids and there was a high window and the zombies were tryna get in and they was screaming. it looked like a utter shht hole like how could anyone survive, the zombies were literally arms in the window and i think they was pushing the door shut. but then my dad skipped it cause i was so scared!
but i'm not a pussy anymore i wanna watch thisssss! and no i really don't think it was world war z cause i saw that already and their was no teenage daughter just two little girls. that part i remember cause of the sunlight was really pretty in her room

"tryna find a movie from my child hood i believe it may be vintage but these young adults go to a cabin retreat in the woods. they cross a bridge i think to get there. later someone gets a purple bruise/marking that causes them to do evil things. like this one woman got chopped to pieces and the pieces were still moving like she was possessed. 

there was a basement that showed a a big glowing monster/s on drawing paper. later showing those monsters outside they were yellow and so menacing.

there was this woman being attacked by vines like they were all over her and this man came to save her.
at the very end the same man was the last survivor but he left the house at the turn of daylight only to have those vines rushing towards him and the movie aburtly ends with him screaming in terror


bonus points: there's these people in a snow retreat and zombies come at them. one guy gets his belly button caught on a tree i think and another guy got his arm bit and he chainsawed it off only to get bit in the crotch but he got in a car i think and just left. i think those zombies could talk?


extra extra bonus:
there's this serial killer going around killing people like this one boy was killed on a ice skating rink(roller skating rink?) but there was this girl i think who witnessed it all and he never went after her.  
later there was this rich preppy girl and she had a big party and i remeber her friend goes rolling in on roller skates with her head decapitated and lands in her birthday cake she screams about the cake and not her friend. and at the end the two girls are downstairs the birthday girl i think and the girl that was never hurt by the killer. and they're both in a room with him.
i think he wanted the girl to kill the preppy one and gave her a knife but she stabbed him and ran off locking the preppy girl in the room with him.

"can someone explain ghostface from the scream series to me? how are normal, average humans in the scream franchise, able to hurt, stab and throw people around as if they're ragdolls? how do normal, average teenagers and young adults somehow have the physical attributes on par of that of the highest tier olympic-level athletes?

for example, in scream 2, billy loomis’ mother, debbie, casually tosses cici off of the balcony of the omega beta zeta house and physically overpowers randy after casually pulling him inside, tossing him and about as if she was some female michael myers. in scream 4, we also have jill roberts, a small woman at just 5’2” brutally stabbing jenny, one of the young teens at the beginning of the movie, and tossing her over the stairs as she struggles to get away. later on, she taunts, harasses, stabs and casually throws sidney’s news reporter/journalist, rebecca walters, off a multi-story building as if she was jason voorhees. and, there’s also the fact that she deliberately self-harmed, tried to once again kill her cousin after they both are taken to the hospital and casually throws sidney into one of the cabinets. she also had enough vitality and stamina to beat dewey with a pot or some heavy object. and let’s not forget the fact that she was able to stab officer perkins through the skull as if it was butter. 

but it doesn’t stop there—finally, we have piper shaw, who, although very average and un-intimidating by physical appearances, was able to take off a man’s head, slit his girlfriend’s throat and casually throw her body into the pool like a rag doll, easily carry a teenage girl and hurl her over the balcony of her house with the noose of a rope around her neck, essentially killing her, and easily snapped a prison guards neck without any effort at all as if she had the strength of jason voorhees.

cecila being trapped in a violent and abusive relationship to the brilliant adrian griffin a world leader in optics gives me a  dr.jekyll and mr.hyde vibe. i believe we can all agree the novel has been easily viewed about the good and evil that exist in all men. the twist i enjoy the most is how both the invisble man and dr jekyll and mr.hyde both represent the theme duality. you see a successful dr who helps people day in and day out. and it becomes nature to assume they are good people. little do you know they're menaces who wreak havoc in more ways then it seem we ever will know. ultimately i enjoyed how both the novel and book show us you can be a terror but its how you behave when certain people are around. that to me was truly terrifying to come to terms with monsters can be youe neighbour and you might not even know.

"the stand tv movie. i have to preface this by saying i love king and have been a constant reader since i learned how to read.

i haven't read everything he's put out, but definitely the vast majority.

that said, movies with his name have a mixed track record for quality. some of the best movies ever made are king adaptations (shawshank redemption, green mile, the shining) but there are some also some good bad (maxum overdrive) and bad bad (the dark tower) movies made with his name attached to them. this one falls somewhere in the middle.

now, it follows the book... mostly, and is mostly well made. has a production quality that's somewhere between an 80s sitcom and a lifetime movie. the acting is usually good, with a few standouts, and i have no major complaints about the sound and special effects.

now, all that said, if there was ever a movie that is in dire need of a remake, it's this one. the movie is a tv movie, so language and gore and sex and grossness are cleaned up to an acceptable 90s cable tv level. they do a mostly good job of keeping the content in tact while also keeping it pg, but, kings writing style is pretty abrasive and outright crass, so cleaning it up doesn't really do it justice. this needs to be remade as a hard ""r"", into a showtime or hbo series imho. somewhere that won't require censorship.

it, for example, really benefitted from a modern version that didn't require made for tv censorship, and in my opinion, this deserves the same treatment. 

all that said, the core of the story is still here, and the characters are amazing and well written and there is a lot to love here, so if you haven't seen it, it's absolutely worth a watch.

molly ringwald is here, playing a girl next door college-age girl who is the subject of multiple character's affections, and gary sinise is here playing gary sinise.

one of my favorite characters (my life for you!) trash is played by matt frewer, who is famous for playing max headroom.

also here is bill faggerbakke, also famous as being the voice of patrick star. one of patrick's lines in spongebob is a direct reference to the stand (m o o n, that spells moon!)

if nothing else, watch it for probably the most memorable openings of any movie in history, and the entire reason i listen to blue oyster cult now.

"someone please help me name this horror movie i can’t remember! i remember when i was kid i watched this horror movie on tv about a haunted house. there was this biggish family that lived in said house. different family members tried to leave the house but the ghosts still followed them, and they were told they have to stick together, and that the demons would follow them wherever they go. i think they even hired an exorcist to come to the house, idk. sorry if this seems vague!!

"home with a view of the monster (2019) - indie horror plot synopsis:  *after placing their secluded lake house on a vacation rental app, dennis and rita return early to discover increasingly eerie secrets left by their recent guests. they slowly begin to uncover the horrors that transpired within their home.*

i stumbled on this horror/mystery/thriller movie recently when i was surfing through amazon prime. it was directed by brother filmmakers alex and todd greenlee. according to imdb this is their first feature. i don't want to give too much away because it goes into so many unexpected directions. i thought that even though it had a few technical flaws (it is very much an indie movie) it was such an incredibly fun and unique story. there is so much to it that lends itself for multiple viewings. the movie hides so many different details throughout. the low imdb rating does not do it justice at all. this definitely makes me want to seek out more movies like it. reminds me a lot of the battery (2012). if you are into genre-blending movies then this one is definitely worth the watch.",0

ok so a few years ago i had seen a movie on netflix named “vice” where in the beginning scene it has a couple traveling, they encounter a woman who had ran out of gas and naturally drove her home. when they arrived the girl got out and offered them something seemingly out of kindness. when she comes back she’s wearing a gas mask, gassed the couple and they wake up in a house with other strangers who can only escape by being tortured and enduring a certain amount of pain. now i don’t remember a lot of this movie because i was young but i most definitely remember it existing. now near the end of the movie we find out one of the guys in there who looks like a surfer guy, is the one behind all of it after they get out. we found out the girl out of the beginning couple is pregnant, but, she dies before escaping. but i also remember that the girl in the beginning begging for a ride home, was in the ending scene and she is eventually kidnapped or killed i don’t remember, by the guy out of the couple. and then go to credits. i remember this movie existing because i had watched it more than once and i can find literally 0 trace of it ever existing. i’m trying to not sound crazy but i can not find it anywhere (imdb, google, other streaming services, etc). does anyone know what i’m talking about? or at least find it? i remember the cover of the movie was vice wrote in what looks like blood, and a vice grip right under it. there was a lot more to the cover but that’s all i can remember about it. someone help i promise i’m not crazy!",0

"""it's an evil fucking room"" movies hi everyone,

i love horror movies, but like all of you, i have my tastes within the genre. i don't much like slashers or human-on-human violence (*hostel* is an extreme example of the sort of human-on-human torture porn that i can't stomach). i like paranormal movies—man vs. supernatural—and within that there's a certain niche that i adore. i call them ""evil place"" movies. i distinguish them from haunted house movies (which are about ghosts or entities localized to a certain place). in the movies i like, it's the *place itself* that is evil. 

here is a representative sample, and i hope you can help me expand my list:

—*room 1408* (from which the title quote is taken)

—*as above, so below* 

—*the shining*

—*grave encounters*

a close-cousin subgenre are ""evil things"" movies, which i also like:

—*oculus* (an evil mirror)

—*sinister* (an evil film projector)

—*ouija: origin of evil* (you can guess) 

—the *annabelle* films (evil doll)

thanks for your help!",0

"looking for ideas for my niece's horror movie introduction hey, horror movie fans! my niece will be 13 in a few days, and my sister asked her what she wanted to do to make it special. my extra-cool niece decided she wanted to watch her first ""cheesy slasher film."" my sister and i ran through some options already, but i thought i'd do what i usually do and get ideas from reddit. 

exclusions/limitations 

1) my sister, for her own reasons, excludes anything with sex scenes and nudity. 
2) we suspect she's looking for a cool brag to her friends, too. it should be something a teenager would be impressed by. 
3) scream was excluded, since it loses its referential value for people who've yet to see other horror films. 
4) it can't be so ""out there"" that it's not available to stream/rent from home, for obvious reasons.

"help! i'm looking for a movie a friend watched. split personalities, kidnapping, not the movie split. i have a friend that watched a movie two or three years ago and they can't remember the title. i've been looking for a week and i cant find it either.

it starts with a bunch of girls at a birthday party, three of them leave and they get kidnapped/drugged/locked in a car with a guy after the one girls dad is knocked out then they wake up in this (completely) white room and the guy thinks he's a mom and is wearing this purple dress and talking with a weird accent.

i can tell you it's not the movie split, he watched that and it's not that. if anyone knows what movie it is it would be a huge help. thanks!

edit: i talked to them and this is what they can remember.

it's really  messed up.

so basically this guy had split personalities and one day he snapped/got possessed and kidnapped three little girls. the one escaped and he chased her down, raped her, then killed her. the second one another one of his personalities took over so he was acting like a little kid and playing with this girl and they got outside. he suddenly snapped back into his possessed side and cut the second girls stomach open. yelling and screaming at her to beg him for forgiveness for tricking him well he's eating her organs. he storms back in where he's keeping the third girl planning to kill her too, and she's not where he left her. he tracks her down and decides he's gonna rape her too, then decides he's gonna kill her by cutting her chest open but sees the scars on her stomach from suicide attempts and decides that he's going to let her go. she runs and tells the police and they storm the building where he was at but he's not there. the movie ends with the dad of the girl putting her to bed and closing the door. the guy that kidnapped her is in her closet, he steps out with a knife and whispers ""we're not done yet"" as he starts walking towards her.

&amp;#x200b;

edit2: it's not split. he hadn't seen split before watching this one. he only watched it recently to see if it was the movie we're trying to find. it's not split.

edit3: if you recognize any of these details from any movie it could be helpful. even if it doesn't fit every single detail. i'm asking because it was slightly traumatizing to him and we're trying to help him.",0

"midsommar and hereditary hey folks! 

so i watched midsommar two days ago (since in my country it just got released on amazon prime) and i really liked it. however, i am not what you would call a typical horror fan, simply because i am easily scared and cannot stomach too much violence. for reference: other horror movies which i really liked were the lighthouse, the witch and get out. since i finally managed to watch midsommar, which besides it’s really shocking moments of violence was not too bad for me. thus, i wanted to ask: if midsommar was more or less fine for me, can i watch hereditary? is it more shocking, creepier or else? how do they compare to each other simply in the sense of „how hard is it to watch the movie for me“, baring in mind that midsommar was fine, even though the violence was kinda heavy for me. thank you for all your answers i’m advance, cheers! 

tldr; i am easily scared and finally dared to watch midsommar. i want to watch hereditary now, but i am unsure whether i can or not, in the sense of how scary/violent/shocking the movie is in comparison to midsommar.",0
"pet semetary 2019 i didn't mind this too much at first, honestly sometimes it was very watchable as a straight remake. but that changes about 2/3 of the way through.

the remake makes little changes from the 89 film, none of which are too extreme, that is, until the third act, at which time the 2019 film takes a big shit all over the book and 89 versions and does it's own thing, which in this case, takes subtlety and emotion and throws it right out the door.

its over the top and hamfisted. the third act of the 2019 film kills it for me, hard.

now, i enjoyed what i saw up until this point, the 2019 film has a few parts that are very non subtle nods to the 89 film, alluding to having a certain thing happen that happened in the original film, only to do something different purposely. almost like an intentional message that says, fuck you i'm gonna do what i want.

overall it had its ups and downs, but was mostly ups until the third act hit, which i hated the direction they took this in. the 89 movie was about dealing with loss and the emotions people have while dealing with it. judd lost norma (who was alive well into the book, and was even saved  from death, and not by the magic zombie cemetary) the kids were dealing with their own loss, being uprooted and having to settle in in a new place, and losing the cat... temporarily. to me, the end of the remake loses the emotion and subtlety dealing with this subject matter and instead goes directly for a horror type ending. if that's your thing, that's fine, but it didn't work for me.

lithgow as judd was one of the highlights for me, fred gwynne was also amazing in the 89 version, but each in their own way. lithgow felt more pained and gwynne felt more rustic and believable. 

the biggest blunder a king based movie can make is changing too much. i don't understand why anyone would try to rewrite or out write king (save for his sometimes horrible endings), and this is where the two films really separate. the 89 version stays mostly faithful with tweaks here and there, and the remake takes the basic story and character and plot points and does whatever the fuck it wants around those.

book - classic

89 movie - solid

2019 movie - anarchic and mediocre.",0

okay so i highly recommend watching it, but its very, very strange so be ready for that. this sociopathic rich kid gets into some trouble and his mother sends him to some kind of weird medical facility that seems to be filled with beautiful women. there doesn't seem to be any staff, just a robot that gives him these pieces that come in plastic packaging with a scalpel, and instructions to carve out chunks of his own flesh and replace it with the piece in the package. his interactions with the other patients are pretty odd, and he becomes obsessed with a girl who is also a patient there. she says they are on different parts of their journey, and in order to catch up to her, he rushes ahead with his replacements. eventually, he finds out that the doctor there is really his father, and i honestly can't even put into words the bad acid trip that comes after. the whole thing is kind of a bad acid trip and i would really love for someone to explain to me what the heck is going on or at least soak in the strangeness with me!",0

"discussion of the perfection (2019, netflix) spoilers below!

hi all, new to this subreddit! i just watched the perfection for the first time, and holy cow that was something. with this whole social distancing thing that’s happening now, the horror buff in me started craving something new. i’ve seen so many movies, from the classics, to the really gory and gross, to the mindfucks, and i’ve come to expect sub-par work from netflix. i’ve had this movie saved in my list for a while and i’m glad i finally watched it.

for a netflix original, this checked a lot of my boxes. it had the gore (enough for me, i’m not a huge fan of it), the plot twists, the lgbtq+ representation (always a + unless you make the all the gay characters crazy or villans), it made me empathize with the main characters, etc. there were times i was itchy, holding my breath, cursing under my breath, all of it! i will say though that the underlying message i picked up, especially near the end, was half put together. i felt like this was a metaphor for how trauma victims cope and how the world sees them in general, as well as the mentality trauma victims often have before, during, and after the incident(s) occur. i’m not gonna go too deep into that, but i felt how tainted the main characters felt after they left the academy. however it was subtle enough that i could have just been overthinking it. the story was well written and put together, so i feel like it couldn’t be a coincidence that i thought they were hinting at something deeper, especially with their backstories and the connection they made.

i also feel like the ending left almost no questions for me, other than what happens to anton (personally i don’t care to know). lizzie and charlotte’s last performance to me was a completion of their story. now that the academy is done for, they can move on with their lives (assuming they don’t get major prison time). the illusion was shattered, and they can pick up the pieces. i don’t think there will be a sequel, and i think this deserves a rewatch just so i can get a better understanding of it with the new information. but anyways, what do you all think? am i thinking too deep on this? somehow i feel like i always am haha!",0

"weirdly entertaining recently, while working from home, i was playing some horror movies on netflix in the background to help pass the time. my job is pretty lax, especially now with the social distancing, so i mostly just get paid to sit around, wait for phone calls, and watch movies (best job ever right?).

i watched 'the bye-bye man' the other day, and it was oddly entertaining? like, it definitely wasn't the best horror movie i've ever seen, and i'm not the greatest judge of a film's decency because i enjoy watching both good and bad horror films, but it was actually not a trainwreck.

i wouldn't say it was scary, and the overall plot was fairly predictable, but for the most part, i liked it for what it was, and it was definitely ok for a one-time watch. i'd recommend it if someone's bored and in the mood for something within the horror genre that's not too freaky but kind of mind-bendy.

"i've been trying to find a horror movie for a while... so i'm coming to this subreddit because i think you guys would be a good help in finding a horror movie i've been trying to find from my childhood. i only remember a few scenes, so if one of you can piece it together that would be great!

from what i remember it looked very similar to hellraiser, in that it was gothic people with leather outfits and piercings and they had kidnapped a guy. other than that i remember a scene where one of the killer ladies (she had a punk-mohawk and a leather outfit) was chasing the kidnapped guy with a needle and was trying to stick him with it. out of nowhere one of the other kidnapped victims (a girl) smacks the gothic lady with a pole and kills/knocks her out. other potential scenes (might be blending movies here) is that it starts off with the soon to be kidnapped guy/protagonist and his roommate (i think) in an apartment or dorm of some sort and they put in a vhs tape and watch it (it isn't the ring i know that). the only other scene i remember is the kidnapped guy being in a trailer with a wooden floor and the gothic people are chain sawing to bottom. 

other than that, i watched the movie in the early/mid 2000s, but it easily could've been from the 80s or 90s. i dont remember much else. 

if you could help me figure this out that would be great, because this has been bugging me for years!

edit: one more scene that just came to me. the protagonist escapes the goth people and he's hiding from them in vents above what i think is a hospital. the main bad guy goth person's right hand woman was the mohawk lady and since she was killed she was replaced with another woman with longer hair (and i think her skin was green?) and they're torturing some guy in a hospital bed, and the escaped protagonist is looking down from the vents as they're   doing it.",0
"body bags (1993) i had never heard of this one until last night, which is odd because i love john carpenter. 

this is an anthology horror film with 2 segments by carpenter, and 1 by tobe hooper.

carpenter does the soundtrack for the film, and it's amazing as always, though a little more reserved than his usual. john carpenter plays a small role in the film, along with some surprising appearances by other people within the horror genre. its worth watching for this alone.

all 3 of the segments are absolutely entertaining and watchable, if slightly predictable, with the first one being pretty suspenseful. 

anyway, it's on amazon prime. check it out.",0

"crawl or die (2014) https://imdb.com/title/tt2219210/?ref_=m_nmfmd_prd_2

i came across this one night years ago while scraping the bottom of the barrel for something to watch. 

i'm claustrophobic as fuck. as such, this is the only movie i've seen that gives the descent a run for its money on triggering my claustrophobia anxiety.

so a woman, known simply as ""the package"" (snicker) is being led by a group to safety through a series of underground tunnels. said woman is the last known fertile woman on the planet and the species is dwindling sharply. 

she ends up being hunted by some thing(s?) and the longer they go through the tunnels, the smaller the tunnels get. 


its low budget, and by no means amazing, but if you feel like giving yourself anxiety and are claustrophobic, give it a watch.

on a side note, one of the lead characters is a dead ringer for glory in fallout 4.

i give it an anxiety attack/10.",0

"monsters (tv show). 80s anthology horror. essentially this is a spiritual continuation of tales from the darkside, as immediately after tales stopped production, the producer richard rubenstein started working on this. 

it feels just like tales, but lower budget and more campy. monsters also tends to focus more on horror and has less sci fi/fantasy type segments. each episode also typically features a monster or character as the center of the episode, often animatronic or green screen type stuff.

the special effect are definitely a product of their time and dont hold up too well today. that's not to say they're all bad, as some of them look good enough to temporarily suspend disbelief, but that's honestly the exception. most are bad enough to be noticeable and can take you out of the moment. personally i don't mind this. having grown up on things like are you afraid of the dark and tales from the crypt, this is right up my alley. in the case that you didn't, it might be hard to get past this.

as with any anthology, the stories are a mixed bag, some are good, but some aren't, objectively. personally, i still enjoy them even when they aren't great. the upside of short form anthology shows is that even if it sucks, it will be over soon and you can move on to something different. 

it's available on prime video, and is probably worth your time as a bedtime watch if you run out of x files to watch. personally, i could watch shows like this non stop and never get tired of them, but most people value their time much more than me.

if nothing else, watch it just for the intro. i always wanted to see the monster family get their own episode.",0

"best/scariest horror movies 1.  midsommar:  this is more of a psychological thriller, but it also has some creative deaths/killings.  this movie was one of the few movies that actually shook me up a bit.  the shooting of it is great, the set design is amazing, the effects are amazing, the acting is spectacular.  i love everything about this movie honestly.  the ending is also really good.

2.  hereditary:  this one was also scary but sometimes the cgi was a bit cheeses.  it has a few terrifying and memorable moments, like when the mom starts banging her head on the attic door.  it’s not my favorite movie but it’s up there.

3.  the strangers:  now this isn’t the best quality one and is a bit lower on my list, but it does have a really good scare factor.  one of the things that i love about the movie is how they have many chances to kill their victims, but don’t because they want to scare and stalk them before they kill them.  their motive “you were home” was also scary because when the killer has no motive it becomes scarier.  the only thing i would change is the ending bc it kind of made it less scary.

4. carrie (the 2002 version):  i am obsessed with the carrie series, and i would have to say the movie i was most impressed with was the 2002 one.  the acting was phenomenal and it was the most loyal to the book.  the way the camera snakes when carrie unleashed her powers is super creepy, and the fact that barely anyone made it out of the prom made it even scarier.  it also didn’t just rely on cheap effects and jump scares to make it scary like the 2013 version did, and the person actually playing carrie was actually scary unlike the 1976 version imo.",0

"bloodride this is a horror anthology recently released on netflix.

i'm only 3 episodes in, but i really like what i see so far. it feels like a mix of twilight zone, in that each episode has a twist, and tales from the crypt, in that it feels very raw and gory and unfiltered. 

this was originally a norwegian show i believe, and the english voices are all dubbed over the original show. i don't mind this much honestly, but i would prefer that it be in it's original language with subtitles. either way, the dubbing is incredibly obvious and took me out of the show a few times, so if this is something that bothers you in movies than this is probably best avoided.

either way, if you're on the lookout for a modern and new horror anthology that's not overly political (looking at you new twilight zone) or tries to shove an agenda down your throat, check it out.

"(spoilers) paranormal activity 4 question so i’ve been watching the paranormal activity movies chronologically every week and after i finish i watch the dead meat podcast episode about it on youtube. so i just finished pa 4 and they chelsea made a point (spoiler inbound) that you never knew why the mom (presumably katie) was taken in an ambulance, ultimately resulting in hunter being taken. that got me thinking and here’s why: later in when hunter and robbie go to robbies house, you meet katie and then alex grabs hunter and goes home. she’s talking to the her mom and she makes the point that she didn’t look sick. “no shit she’s possessed by a demon” is what was going through my mind but what if alex has a point. what if robbie has a real mom and that katie just showed up converted him, killed his mom or like made her sick (i don’t know if toby could do that tbh) and then sent robbie and etc. i told my dad about this but he thought it wouldn’t make sense so i don’t know. for a movie this boring and not thought out (surprise i don’t like this movie lol) it seemed oddly convoluted. am i missing something??

/edit/ oh my god i don’t know why this just clicked but it makes more sense to me now. so basically, the reason we have this footage is because the “police find them and katie is missing”. so if katie was taken in an ambulance they have to take record of her and the police would probably recognize her from the case even though it started in cali... so how could be it her anyway? her whole cult would be discovered or at least she wouldn’t be there for hunters arrival. i’m don’t know. if this is common knowledge i’m sorry!!!! im watching the next one on monday since my school is canceled due to corona. i’ll correct myself if i’m being stupid lmao",0

"ti west's: the innkeepers (2011) [review] ""i'm not negative, i'm a realist.""

the supernatural is such an interesting subject because of the separation of believers, the ethnic and religious views, spiritual guidance, fearless hunting for contact that leads people to tell their stories of interaction that are controversially believed and debated at length for some sort of credibility. 

ti west's the innkeepers places our two main characters claire (sara paxton) and luke (pat healy) inside the yankee pedlar hotel, open for it's last weekend before shutting down for good. the two are supernatural enthusiasts and claire is open to the idea of helping luke and his website with investigations surrounding the supposed hauntings at the hotel. 

""i'm a pumpkin. i gotta kill the snake.""

as impressive as this movie started out building atmosphere and characters, it welcomed me into this world and i felt like at times i was standing inside the yankee pedlar, it equally fell apart in the last act which left me a little confused and very underwhelmed. it was shaping up to be a solid ghost story despite minor story contrivances that i was more than willing to look past because these two main characters, especially claire, are charismatic and charming, at times a little silly but all relatable nonetheless. claire has a child-like naivety that feels as if it plays a roll in the world of the hotel we are consumed in. the usage of kelly mcgillis as ex-actress leanne rease-jones was improperly used and served no real purpose within the film which is a shame because she is such a fantastic actor and that certainly was on display when she was on screen. ti west seems to have pulled back at times when it was shaping up to be creepy and could have taken an extra step with the horror elements that were building off of the dark atmospheric vibe he was shaping together. the innkeepers was filmed on location at the yankee pedlar hotel in torrington, connecticut. this hotel has been reported as being truly haunted by several spirits, crew members on set claimed to have seen and heard odd things that could not be explained which automatically enhances the creepiness for me so with a little bit of research beforehand may heightened your experience.

all in all, great first half of the film coupled with a solid script and solid acting, a precisely built atmosphere along with beautiful camera work that leads us to a spook in the last act with a clunky ending as the story telling falls down a flight of stairs and bangs it's head. the lack of emotion from anyone involved at the end of the film was a huge problem for me but fortunately there are other great qualities about it and is an absolutely worth while watch.

my all time favourite monster comes from frankenstein's army. picking between all the monsters is a pretty brutal choice, but i'll try to not be basic and leave out mosquito man to make it more fair. i'd say by not including him out that leaves the diver as my favourite all time movie monster, especially since the sonar pings really added to his suspense. a close second is t-35, and i'll leave it there before it becomes a list of frankenstein's army monsters.

or belial from basket case. i remember the base doctor scene from wwz of this decomposed zombie barely moving and rotting into the floor, that's the stuff that really gets to me. i'm also a huge fan of demons and ghosts, but only if it's done in a legitemate religeous manner rather than a generic demon/ghost chasing a group. 

i'm personally not a fan of zombie horrors or a psycho chasing people off into the woods (texas chainsaw massacre, friday the 13th, etc.) and i'm not into movies where you root for the killer to finish off the group of drunk fratboys and thirsty girls. i might get a lot of slack for this last one, but i have yet to find a large amount of japanese horror movies that i really enjoyed, i'm just not into their kind of stuff.

so, what's everyones preferences and least favourite movie types? anything over (or under) rated that you love/hate to see?",0

"so, i just watched martyrs. any more suggestions on good phychological/gruesome horrors? this movie was the first that had me running to turn on the lights in my room (from the last scene). i have never experienced such true fear from a movie. one cup of hot chocolate grew cold and my snacks were left untouched from this film. no jumpscares, just disgusting effects and phychological horror. i could tell myself ""it's just a movie"" for most of it, i'll say the movie won in the end

although i know i'll never watch that movie again, i want to know if there's more movies this freaky out there. i'm a huge fan of phychological films with practical effects. i'm not a fan of movies that display rape and sexual assault due to personal experiences, and i also feel that's a cheap cop out for any phychological horror. i've seen a lot of movies, and i'd love more suggestions on good horrors. i can't possibly fathom a movie more terrifying than this one, but i would love to hear of more movies that might compete for my personal scariest movie.

&amp;#x200b;

\*edit: i'm also a huge fan of demon/monster movies if that helps or suggestions! to give back to the community a bit i'd also suggest frankensteins army, they have beautiful practical effects i have't seen since the thing (original)",0

"the boogeyman series does anyone remember the boogeyman movies? they were something i actually ended up watching on youtube and i saw the second 1 first before finding the others and i just need to talk about them.

&amp;#x200b;

these movies are surprisingly hard to find and when i asked my bf to do so he said they were all in spanish but i clearly remembered watching them in english and it definitely wasnt dubbed. i looked them up and seeing that they were 2000 movies i thought it was really weird how hard they were to find. i mean they werent great movies sure but they werent so horrible that they should have been that hard to find.

&amp;#x200b;

the first one was bad in that it suffered from all the 2005 horror tropes, zoom in slow mo, loud jumpscares, a bland cast, and ugh....some time travel elements. it's too bad as the story was solid, i mean we were all kids we all knew about the boogeyman and were scared of him at some point, i know i was. the first movie is....well its kind of hard to remember that fear with closet doors being blown off hinges and some dude being constantly reminded that his father ran off instead of got sucked into the closet like he saw happen. there's also a little ghost girl who presents plot for some reason....it was a mess after the second act really.

&amp;#x200b;

now the second boogeyman movie was awesome.....purely for the reason it detached it's self from the first entirely. it was a who new story with a whole new cast of characters and the story was great. we've got two kids who are scared of the boogyeman and by extension the dark hallway. there dad fixes the light and as hes doing so his daughter sees him brutaly murdered by a man who comes out of the closet wearing all black with a hidden face. then her brother finds her and they try to escape together and they find there mother knifed to the wall in the kitchen....jesus. then we see that henry went to a pshyc ward and his sister ...laura i think, delt with this much better....spoiler warning...she did  not deal with it well. so after henry gets out she goes in to be in the same program with a bunch of people who have fear, some rational some erational. very quickly people start dying and the movie makes a bold move by accenting each person killed with there fear in some very creative ways. we find out that the killer is actually henry because the main doctor shoved him in a closet to make him face his fear and it kind of broke him.

&amp;#x200b;

side point: this same doctor tried this method on another patient who also went crazy killed a bunch of people and then himself.....why the hell would you do this again and think it would work

&amp;#x200b;

now the third movie.....is the worst and why is that....it connects its self to the second movie. in fairness this could be done very well....sadly it wasnt. the third movie goes back to the boogeyman being and entity of fear and that beleiving in him makes him real, like freddy krueger. it also follows a lot of urban legend type tropes....and not well. the biggest problem is it being an entity of fear because remember....henry was the killer in the second movie....he went crazy and killed everyone this movie could have been its own thing and still be bad.....but i feel like connecting to the second movie made it even worse.  this entity of fear is killing everyone not because of fear....but because of....belief, after a little bit you start to forget this is even about the boogeyman and feel like its more of a poor man freddy krueger. the whole urban legend vibe also bothers me purely because the movie urban legend was pretty great.

&amp;#x200b;

all in all....boogeyman is a nostalgic watch....maybe try three first, get the worst out of the way you know",0
"indie horror movie about a comedian w/psychosis there was this fantastic horror movie i think i saw on netflix several years ago, i forgot the name and was wondering if anyone could help me out.

it had a dark, eraserhead vibe, i can't remember if it was black and white though, i don't think so.

it was set in a desert, it looked to me like nevada, the protagonist was this obese, grotesque man in a black suit, he was desperately trying to be a comedian but his jokes where really corny and crappy, he meets a drifter, and the drifter helps him make people laugh... i don't want to ruin the movie for anyone going on, it really is good if you like atmospheric pseudopsychadelic horror like eraserhead, or the lighthouse.  i think it's got a lot in common with the new joker movie too, 

&amp;#x200b;

i truly appreciate the help finding out what this movie is titled!",0

"prison. 1987 horror movie with viggo mortensen. until this evening i hadn't seen this movie since it originally came out on crappy vhs, when i watched it back-to-back with night of the creeps.

the plot is fairly simple: in the 1960s, charlie forsythe dies in a wyoming state prison's electric chair. twenty years later, the prison is re-opened and one of the guards at charlie's execution is now the warden. when the walled-up execution chamber entrance is broken down, charlie's spirit is freed and people start dying. it seems like he's after the warden, but why?

good movie. well-made on a fairly low budget and shot in a real abandoned prison, which adds some atmosphere. some extras were even played by real prisoners. it takes a while for the deaths to start, but they're pretty creative and gruesome and the makeup effects are good too. the director was renny harlin in his hollywood debut, and he got a lot out of a little. not surprising he was hired to make nightmare on elm street 4 after this.

interesting to see viggo mortensen in a very early role. there are some familiar '80s faces, like lane smith, chelsea field, lincoln kilpatrick, and tiny lister. future jason vorhees kane hodder is briefly in it too; he plays two roles, although you can't see his face in either one. field's character wasn't really necessary to the plot. the movie is a bit overlong at 104 minutes, and her scenes could have been cut without affecting the story very much.

prison never received a dvd/br release in north america until 2013, when it finally got one courtesy of shout factory. the movie is worth a look for fans of obscure '80s horror. i'd give prison a **7/10.**",0
"making friday the 13th scary hey everyone.

"review on “area 51” from 2015 (quick summary on bottom) “area 51” is a found footage film about a group of people that plan to break into area 51 after one of their friends “reid” has a weird experience after a party 

i’ve watched this movie on netflix a few years back but since then they took it down (for canada at least). i went to watch this movie again since when i watched it the first time i liked it and in the second watch, i liked it even more. 

after i finished the movie i went to see some reviews on it to see how people liked it and for the most part people found it terrible. most of their reasons were about how the movie was unexplained and was open to many questions. 

i personally love unexplained movies that end with you thinking about it so maybe this is just a personal preference but i actually enjoyed this movie. some reviews i agree with when they say the last act in the movie seems a bit rushed but besides that the movie is pretty good.

this movie was not particularly “scary” to me but it did have creepy elements to it. unlike other horror movies these days, this movie doesn’t make a loud piano noise when something happens so it gives me more respect for the film

(overall)
“area 51” is definitely an acquired taste to certain people but if you enjoy unexplained and/or found footage movies this film would be something that you might want to look into 

imo  7/10

"am i the only one who didn’t like “hereditary?” for one, i felt as though it was way too long. secondly, the first hour of the film only served to depress me (but i’ve dealt with a lot of death in my family within the last year, so perhaps that’s just on me). thirdly, the final half of the feature was just a hodgepodge of “ghosts” and what i consider to be tame witchcraft nonsense.

don’t get me wrong, i love toni colette and gabriel byrne as actors, and went into this feature expecting a lot. toni delivered, if nothing else, but...

it didn’t scare me, it didn’t thrill me, and i’m honestly just left disappointed overall. am i alone on this?",0

the movie was on festival circuit since late 2018. than, it had special sreenings for events in late 2019. it finally came out january 1 2020. don't judge the movie by the trailer. for sure it is a small movie, but small movies are the best in my opinion. especially for horror movies. if you saw the movie, i want to know what did you think of it. did you hate it, did you like it?

"could i have some help identifying this movie/show? hi i was wondering if anyone could help identify a movie/show i saw a long time ago. it’s kind of obscure but i remember one scene semi-clearly. 

the scene was the main character was watching her tv and night of the living dead was on. and it was the part where the guy says “they’re coming to get you barbara”. but instead of barbara, the movie said her, the main character’s, name instead. and then she realized it and rewound it but instead of her name again, the guy on the tv said barbara.

sorry if this is super obscure but it’s been bugging me for a while and i’ve been really wanting to see it again. any info that points me in the right direction would be greatly appreciated. thanks!",0

"the wailing (2016) and korean horror i just saw the wailing, which seems to have quite a hype going on, and while it's definitely an amazing horror movie, i guess i expected the plot to be more surprising and full of twists, perhaps a genre switch, which is what the reviews have promised. i was also hoping it would scare me, since non-american horror movies are generally more scary to me thanks to not knowing what to expect, and japanese horror freaks me out to this day. but nope.

i definitely liked the overarching theme and religious imagery the most. my favourite part was the beginning, with various disturbing incidents all falling into place. the plot really drove home the inevitability of evil and tragedy. overall, it's solid, better than a lot of modern western horror, but the amount of hype gave me maybe unrealistic expectations. 

if you've seen this movie, what is your opinion? and what are other korean horror movies worth recommending? are there are any that are even better than the wailing?",0
"bruce mcdonald's: pontypool (2008) [review] ""have you seen honey?""

grant mazzy (stephen mchattie), local radio host that may very well be on the back nine of his career, jockeying at a small broadcast station in the small village of pontypool. an interesting drive into work late one night foreshadows even stranger things to come, as grant, and his two assistants, sydney (lisa houle)and laurel-ann (georgina reilly) try to make sense of the chaos that is happening outside of the station while they quarantine themselves inside. outbreak? riot? or something unsuspecting? 

pontypool is a small village in ontario part of the amalgamated city of kawartha lakes. only about 2 hours from me via highway toll roads or 3 hour back roads. this adds to the terror of the movie for me, all a little too relatable with the small town radio host working what may possibly be the only radio broadcast in the area, bringing the small population one of their only sources of local news. small communities live and die by their local news. 

""a big, cold, dull, dark, white, empty, never-ending blow my brains out, seasonal affective disorder freaking kill me now weather-front.""

the claustrophobia of this movie is enough to rattle me until the very end, the mysterious and unorthodox transmission of disease is enough to scare me directly out of society. the ""conversationalist"" enemies are clearly derived by social influence, and excite terror in one of the most important aspects of our life....conversation. the dialogue and the incremental receivment of important information is an underlying terror that slowly but surely eats away at you as you find yourself reacting along with the characters as this information trickles in. 

the acting from the few characters that are involved in the film, whether it be on screen or a voice coming through the television or phone was strong and convincing, since this movie is shot in the same location and relies on strong performances, screen writing and mood, to relay it's scary message, director bruce mcdonald and screenplay writer tony burgess do just that. there is a tonne of weight in the script which can certainly be interpreted a few different ways, and warrants a thorough rewatch or two. pontypool isn't gory, although there is use of great practical effects and a few very disturbing scenes, the atmosphere is creepy and mchattie's voice is amazing. 

""kill is blue. kill is wonderful. kill is loving. kill is baby. kill is manet's garden. kill is a beautiful morning.""

i find the strategy of not revealing a backstory of the threat and letting the viewer piece it together themselves heightens the terror and initiates deep discussion, elevating this film above its low budget and sending it into contention for one of canada's great indie horror films. 

i rate this film 4 out of 5
or
8 out of 10",0
"darkness falls i saw this movie as a child and i remember it being scary, i saw it at the age where the tooth fairy was still a thing in my life. watching as i'm older i realize its glaring issues....its a screamer movie. it has these incredibly quiet movies obliterated by the tooth fairy screeching horribly loudly, and i mean to the point where is kind of ruins the atmosphere completely. this would have been fantastic as a quiet terrifying creature.

&amp;#x200b;

also as we move on into the later years of life....does the toothfairy no longer have rules? she just kind of kills a drunk dude in the middle of the woods for no reason, i thought there was a tooth loosing rule here.

now maybe this is nit picking....but why does kats little brother seem old enough to be her son...i just find that really odd.

so they arrest the guy who they say killed his mother, and although it was never proven they say 'oh hes back in town he must have killed this guy' even though it looks like a clear animal attack....and in the middle of the woods.

sensory deprivation also seems really extreme for a child, like i feel maybe some therapy and counseling would be a better bet before we deprive the kid of his senses and make him face his fears. in all fairness the kid is....odd and almost dead seeming but im gonna chalk that up to bad acting skills.

am i the only ones who finds it odd that in a town full of people, who grew up with the legend of the killer toothfairy, there arent some more skeptics that think this thing is real...i feel like a small town like this would be lit up every night just based on superstition. like there is a long list of unsolved murder involving children in the last 100 years and everyone is just like 'whteve'. has no one else seen a human sized flying monster that screams before it attacks.

funny side not....what do you think would have happened if that kid came out torn to pieces like....what do you do in that situation.

and near the climax of the movie everyone just starts believing and listening to old crazy kyle like nvm everyone believing he killed his mother, all your crazy is believed now

anyone else notice the kids accent when he yells kaitlin no as she foes back to get kyle....its kind of funny and very disarming of the moment

so....we got her into a lighthouse and managed to turn the big light on....how the heck does this safe anyone, wasnt she a curse ghosts thing in the first place? like how did she light on fire....were sam and dean coincidently at the cemetary lighting up her bones without knowing any of this was going on on. like a curse is a pretty powerful thing and its managed to keep her spirit vengeful for like 100 years.....but a lighthouse and a fire just stop her now",0

"trackman (2007 russian slasher movie) just watched this. not great, but has its moments. four bank robbers take three hostages from a botched robbery into an abandoned section of the russian metro tunnels underneath moscow where it's rumored that a survivor of the chernobyl disaster lives.

spoiler: the rumors are true. a masked, goggle-wearing dude carrying a pickaxe (and later a &gt;!flamethrower  !&lt;because why not?) starts hunting the robbers and hostages. he also has a thing for collecting the eyeballs of his victims.

this movie could have been better if it had some likable characters, but it doesn't. they're either annoying or dicks, and since the killing spree doesn't start until about halfway through the movie viewers are stuck with them for a while. one of the robbers looks just enough like the hockey player alexander ovechkin that i amused myself by pretending that it was him.

the murders are tame, and there's not that much blood or gore. there's also a lack of suspense and the movie isn't scary. the eyeball-plucking scenes are a bit squirm-inducing but will disappoint gorehounds. talking about the 80-minute ""uncut"" dvd; i don't know how different it is from any other versions of this movie that might be out there.

the best things about trackman are the sometimes-atmospheric visuals and the fairly cool-looking killer. i'd give the movie **5.5/10**. worth a watch for the curious, but not essential viewing. there are other underground-set horror movies that do what trackman does better.",0
"h.p lovecraft's: the unnamable (1988) [horror] [review] ""it was hell down there, howard.""

lovecraft wrote inspiring, ambitious and beautiful stories, some better than others but for the time all of them were far ahead of it. alot of these stories inspired motion pictures, just like the stories some are better than others, this was especially true in the 80's when the horror genre was practical effect driven by some of the best artists we know today. some of these stories are not riddled with lore because alot of them were left open for interpretation and that's what makes them all very interesting, our minds can often make things scarier than intended. 

the story is simple. at miskatonic university in arkham, mass. randolph carter (mark kinsey stephenson) tries to scare his buddies howard (charles klausmeyer) and joel(mark parra) with stories of warlock joshua winthrop (delbert spain) who was murdered by his demonic daughter alyda(katrina alexandre) whom still occupies the house in which these gruesome acts took place. joel does not believe these stories what so ever and decides to spend the night in the house to prove randolph wrong, this does not go over very well as expected, which leads to the side story of two very good looking women, wendy (laura albert) and tanya(alexandra durrell) who are attending miskatonic as freshman's looking to become part of the school's sorority. bruce weeks (eben ham) and john babcock(blane wheatley), two frat boys, convince the women to meet them at the winthrop residence for a night of scares and hopeful copulation. 

""fraternity boys, they've been known to pull pranks on new students.""

this film is a fantastic adaptation of the story by the same name written by h.p lovecraft. it does stray a little bit away from the original story, which is not a long one by any means, bringing it into the modern age, at the time of 1988. the way the female beast is described in the story is almost exactly what i had in my head for the film, the hairy legs and hooves, claws, horns, vampire teeth and bat-like wings projected perfectly on screen. this movie is bloody, with great effects to boot, the shriek of the monster is spine tingling, the layout of the house is confusing, the acting is decent at best but this is a film full of great fun and a beautifully terrifying female monster, which was very rare at the time. 

i rate this movie 3 out of 5 stars

6 out of 10",0

"the hunt for a horror movie for a few years now, bits and scenes of a certain trailer for a horror movie have been resurfacing in the back of my mind, but no matter what i type into google, i can’t find anything remotely close. i’ve been trying to find it for years now. this has really been bothering me lately especially since i remember vividly being so afraid of this trailer for this movie, but i can only remember little parts of it.

some things i remember:

it was either 2012 or 2013 because i was in either in the theatre to watch magic mike, or i was in the theatre to watch jackass presents: bad grandpa. anyways, i remember it being one of the trailers they show before the actual movie, it was a trailer before one of those two movies. 

it was most likely when i went to see bad grandpa (2013) but i can’t completely rule out magic mike either.

i was younger, so can only remember little pieces and things that stood out to me, like:

• a person (an old lady, i think?) being wheeled out of a building (apartment building i’m pretty sure) by paramedics and there was an ambulance.

• i remember a group of people, and i think i remember them commenting on the person, things along the lines of “something was really wrong with (person)”

• the group of people go into the old person’s apartment and find strange weird things. (i think they looked like black candles or something like that, maybe? it was like weird things on a table)

• when they found the weird things in the apartment they said something along the lines of “what the fuck is that.” and the energy in the room was eerie.

•may have been partly “found footage” style.

this is all really vague, i know. :( but hopefully someone saw this movie or this trailer and knows what i’m talking about. any suggestions on what this movie might be?? i’ll try and think of some more stuff from the trailer.

**edit: when the group of people were in the apartment, it was pitch black so they had to use a camera light or flashlight or something to see around.. it even might have been like green camera night vision. this part of the movie i think was kind of like found footage style.

**edit: the thing i know for certain is that the apartment/ room the group of people go investigate belongs to the person who is being wheeled out of the building by paramedics at the start of the trailer.",0
"trying to remember a revenge horror movie hello,

i'm trying to find a film that i would like to watch however i cannot remember the title. i would list it under female led revenge.

the premise was a white english/american girl who had traveled to see her old best friend i think on an island (asian decent). it turns out the girl is treated terribly by the people around her and when her friend decides not to help her and leaves, she takes revenge on the community by killing everyone.

it's fairly gory and i'm sure the title was the girls name, something short that starts with m. i could be incorrect though.

"i need help finding a movie need help finding a movie.

if you're reading this, thanks for the help :)

now, i only remember a few scenes and some facts. let's start with the facts.

1) the movie is shown as if someone was recording it with a normal camera.

2) the cast is a small group ( about 3 to 5 members ) of young adults.

3) there's a monster that has broad shoulders and big arms ( it looks like a gorilla and walks like one ) that's covered in a kind of plant that makes it look like military camouflage ( the kind that's not leaves, but like long stretches of grass that hang down the user's body ).

the group is in a forest and the monster is chasing them at some point in the film. the one scene i remember very clearly is one in which both boys tell the person holding the camera to look at a very small and narrow valley filled with bushes. they exclaim how there's something awesome and emphasize the attention on a single bush; after a minute, the ""bush"" gets up and it is the first time we see the creature.


there's also another scene that i'm not entirely sure of, but it's better than nothing. it is at night when the creature is pursuing them, after they gain some advantage, they come up to a fence and climb it, getting to a football camp-like open field. almost immediately, spotlights are on them and a military officer is telling them via megaphone to get on their knees and place their hands behind their head. the teens try telling them about the creature for about 30 seconds, but the officer just doesn't care. that's when the camera points back and the monster climbs the fence, so they keep on running into this military facility.



i know this is very vague, but i've tried looking for this movie for about five or seven years, if you know of any movie like this, please type it in the comments. thanks!",0

"just *how* terrifying is the babadook? for context, i am studying film, and we have horror as our genre this term.

my crew is looking at doing a psychological horror and a concept that we have floating around concerns fighting a 'monster' that might only be in your head. this made me think of '*the babadook*'. i have heard so many great things about this film, but i am so terrified to actually sit down and finally watch it.

i am personally not a big fan of horror (because i am a weakling) so my repertoire is very limited. i would like to ask about the babadook's level of scariness. i love thrillers and films that delve into the human psyche so the only thing keeping me from watching it is my own fear.

"my bloody valentine (1981) collector's edition blu ray. anyone get it? it came out today. afaik this is the first time this version of the movie has been released on blu ray. there are two discs: the first one is the theatrical cut, and the second one is the version with the extra footage that was cut from the theatrical release. it's identical in content to the special edition dvd that came out in 2009; there's no ""new"" footage. it runs for 93 minutes compared to the theatrical cut's 90.

the picture quality is really good, and it looks like the footage that was added back in was cleaned up too; it was kind of grainy on the dvd release and easy to pick out, but it's much more seamless now. if you've never seen the movie, you probably wouldn't be able to tell which shots were the ""new"" ones.

spoiler: it's nearly all gore shots. this helps make the death scenes more impactful since lots of the payoff shots were removed from the theatrical cut to avoid an x rating. the best kill scene, the shower room death, plays a lot better now. the gore in mbv still holds up pretty well, and it's nice to at least see some of it restored to its former glory, or as close as possible.

there are a couple of bonus features on the second disc. the first one is a 35th anniversary cast reunion from bay of blood 2016 that runs for 46 minutes, and the other is a live performance of the song from the movie's closing credits, ""the ballad of harry warden."" this is also from bay of blood 2016.

my bloody valentine has aged a lot better than most '80s slasher flicks, although it feels tame when compared to the remake. still worth getting.",0
"i cant like the purge, and here's why.... i dont think i will be in the majority on this, but hear me out.... i was perusing another thread in this sub and the purge was mentioned as a realistic horror movie, and several commented on how great it is....which is fine....but it brought up my loathing for this film and i want to see if anyone else feels this way also.

i want to say first, it is entertaining to a degree...its how completely ridiculous the premise is.

the whole point of the purge is to give americans one night to commit any crime, any crime at all, to ""purge"" all of their pent up aggression that so many people want to expel (apparently) and that supposedly makes the crime rate for the rest of the year extremely minimal.  they state in the movie how much of a success this has been, and how great it is for society.  but.....what the actual fuck?  

so, if murder, rape, arson, theft, literally every crime is legal, even if for only one night, how in the hell is society just going to be ""fine"" the next day?  or week?  or month?  

let's say you wake up the next morning unscathed.  you have a doctors appointment, maybe drop your kids at school....lunch with your best friend?  ok, let's hope your doctor wasnt murdered last night...or their family members werent murdered last night, bc doc ain't going to be there to see you if that's the case.
or, well, the school was burned to the ground last night....guess we dont really know when you'll get to go back to school, kiddos!
best friend?  beaten to a pulp and in in the hospital (assuming it wasnt torched to the ground).

society would be a disaster.  you cant just bounce back from all the chaos, devastation, loss and misery this one night has caused.  

i cant stand this movie.  thanks for reading.",0
"david cronenberg's: dead ringers (1988) [thriller] [drama] [horror] [movie review] ""but...i want some icecream.""

there are very few cronenberg joints that disappoint as he as a unique way of telling a story, whether it be through pure story development and character arch or a gruesome way to disturb you through body mutation and acts of sexual deviancy. this film was in the midst of an absolute eight movie tear cronenberg was on through 1975 to 1988 with such movies as ""shivers"", ""rabid"", ""fast company"", ""the brood"", ""scanners"", ""videodrome"", ""the dead zone"", ""the fly"", and lastly ""dead ringers"". to have this movie be in the top echelon of cronenberg films wouldn't be a stretch as i saw a tonne of maturation in dead ringers which made it's almost two hour run time very digestible and entertaining, but this is a far cry from his previous classics and shouldn't be put on the same level as we have come to expect. this is a thriller that does use some body horror elements to shock but does not use a formulaic approach to build suspense and the unnerving obsession we often feel.

elliot and beverly mantle (jeremy irons) are very successful gynecologists who happen to run their own practice in toronto. identically handsome, beverly the quieter and more confined of the two works the research side of things while elliot, the more hands on type, works his clients into bed. as he moves on to different women he gives them over to his brother while the women are none the wiser. beverly ends up falling in love with famous actress claire niveau (geneviève bujold), this sends him into depravity and despair when he believes she is betraying him.

""why don't we have standards of beauty for the entire body, inside and out?""

jeremy irons provides the film with incredible acting that easily separates the two characters. we as viewers obsess about the well being of bev and what we feel claire is contributing to his downfall, we also obsess in what way ellie is helping the situation or how much of this he can take before he inevitably collapses as well, and what comes with that separation. in a change of tone for a cronenberg film i found myself wondering what role the tools for ""mutated women"" would play when showing us the imagery of radical thinking where this could have taken a few different turns, thinking the last third of the movie may use them very creatively. the progression of the story that builds the bleakness of beverlys identity being lost within ellies narcissism and deviancy is just as sad and horrifying as the images of nightmarish gynecology tools laid out on a surgical trolley labeled 1-10. this film is very original in the way that the antagonist is the protagonist, they are the cause of their own subsequent downfalls and a product of absolute tragedy caused by distorted minds.

""there's nothing the matter with the instrument, it's the body. the woman's body is all wrong!""

in 1988, the technology used in this film to create the illusion of irons actually interacting and appearing on screen together as two separate beings is a work of art, it is seamless and convincing. dead ringers is a misogynistic, egotistical, drug influenced and at times beautiful tale of hopelessness in separation between two identical twins and it is one hell of a ride.

"question about antrum- the deadliest movie ever made (may contain spoilers***) ***contains spoilers*** ********

going into this knowing it’s a mockumentary, didn’t take away from the scare factor.  the ring &amp;amp; cigarette burns did this, but antrum took it home to us viewers, which i loved. (hoping that i am still alive when you read this, lol)

i really enjoyed this movie. i loved the creep/dread element that i felt the entire time- very effective.
the random and bizarre imagery really worked for me as well as the forest “extras”.
going through the ‘layers of hell’ is always a scary thought...i loved toad road for this very reason. (most people didn’t like this one, i know)
the ending/s threw me off a bit though.  part 1 ended with nathan (all sooted up from almost being roasted) following the husky through the woods, and staring at the camera with a grin. did he turn into one of those black devils running around the forest?
part 2.  big sis is freaking out in the tent while literally all hell is breaking loose outside. she hears the chains of what she thinks are the dogs and has the gun ready to fire. we see nathan walking towards the tent dragging a chain...does he have a “devil dog” attached or is he just himself trying to get back to his sister??

"did i miss something in it follows that justifies its praise on the internet? i've watched it about 3 times from beginning to end and i am so bored. 

i like to think i've got an open mind, especially when it comes to horror. i'm into the jump-scares, the slow-burns, slashers, supernatural thrillers, low-budget, foreign and pretty much anything dark, really.

i gave it follows a couple of chances because it's on every suggestion or list of horror modern-day classics. but why? it's one of the most nothing movie plots i've ever watched.

right off the bat, the monster sucks and is not scary. it's pretty cheap that it just looks like a person with dark circles under the eyes.

the characters are not interesting at all and i dont ever care what happens to anyone.

i find it hard to be invested in a story where the threat, although seemingly ""unstoppable"" is something you can literally walk away from... and theres only 1 of it you need to worry about.

theres no jump scares, no crazy looking monsters, no good violence, no world building or character development, no amazing soundtrack, no outstanding philosophy or metaphors that have yet to be touched or improved on and an unsatisfying ending. i keep waiting for something significant to happen and nothing really does.  it's not fun.

i'm wondering if someone could shed some light on the appeal of this movie. why do people give it so much credit? did i miss something that makes the whole thing pay off before the credits roll? how does anyone find this ""scary""? does anyone agree with me? 

i'd love to read some thoughts and opinions from fans of the movie and folks like myself.

"stephen king's: graveyard shift (1990) [creature feature] [review] ""you are no lady, doris. far from it.""

i dont know if it's just me but rats always give me the willie's, in a movie, outside, i dont care. although, they are pretty cute little buggers, i wonder what about rats gets us a little on edge, is it the size of them or lack there of? the sharp teeth and unpredictability? or simply, we just know them to be disease infested, either way this flick had me a bit squeamish and let's just say i checked thoroughly under my feet a few times. 

john hall is a drifter going from town to town looking for work. he lands in a small town in maine where he seeks out work at the local textile mill as we learn is infested with rats. the textile mill is run by foreman, mr. warwick, who is pretty much a psychopath and has an absolute hatred for hall after he hits it off nicely with one of the female workers. warwick hires vietnam veteran and exterminator tucker cleveland to take care of the rat problem but cleveland brings attention to the fact that these are no ordinary rats and that the resiliency should force the textile mill to shut down. on the july 4th weekend foreman warwick assembles a basement cleaning crew where they believe the rats are living to take care of the infestation, himself included. there is something else down in the basement with them that starts to pick off crew members one by one.

""we ain't talkin' about no candy-ass field mice.""

this film starts off with a brutally acted scene of graveyard shift worker james reed at the textile mill. he increasingly becomes more surrounded by the rats as the sequence moves along until his inevitable death. this opening scene was still strong enough to keep my attention and effectively gave me a feel for what kind of tone i would be getting for the remainder of the film as it sets up the atmosphere quite nicely despite the downright hilarious acting. 

there are a few very likeable characters as we dont learn a whole heck of a lot about them but just enough to keep us interested. david andrews as john hall and kelly wolf as jane wisconsky, give two key performances as we see an arc in both characters. brad dourif as tucker cleveland is more than likeable and brings some good comedy relief to this dark and dank atmosphere. stephen macht as warwick does a fantastic job of allowing you to straight up despise a man who is one small step away from becoming a psychopath. there is a seperation of fear in this movie between the unknown in the basement and the fear of the unknown in warwick, is he going to lead his crew into the mouth of the beast and watch them all get taken out one by one or will he take them all out himself?

""we're going to hell...together!""

we don't get to see a lot of the creature before the final reveal near the end of the film but it is extremely effective in my opinion when you get glimpses of certain extremities of the beast stabbing, ripping, slicing, gouging or any other word i could use to describe the agony in which said extremity is causing. i thought that the practical effects on the ""mother"" rat's body as a whole looked like a mess and maybe not executed as well as it could have been, but that being said, i did find it to be quite creepy and unsettling.

graveyard shift is ralph s. singleton's only directed movie and it is a really fun little horror flick, not the best written and definitely not the best stephen king story or adaptation but a very enjoyable one. the unsettling atmosphere makes it pretty easy to buy into the film and a few of the characters allow you to have some genuine fun with it as well. after watching this film you can cross another use for empty pepsi cans off the list.

"help me remember this movie title! there was a movie i would watch as a kid -— long story short, we lived overseas and only had vhs tapes (it was the 90s) and sometimes i would sneak my parents movies and watch them, and this was one of them. i remember being so freaked out by this movie, but every time i talk to anyone about it now they are convinced it never existed. i don’t remember much, so here’s what i know:

i would have watched it in the early 90s, so the movie wouldn’t have been made any later than 1993. if i had to guess, i’d say it was probably made between 1981 and 1992.

i remember a younger brother and an older brother. probably high schoolers.  i think the parents were out of town. or it was a male babysitter watching this kid slightly younger than him? i don’t know.

i remember a scene where the older brother and his girlfriend were hooking up, but she stopped him because she couldn’t concentrate (or something). it had to do with his little brother for some reason. but i remember this quote clearly. when she stopped the hook up, he was trying to convince her to stay and he says “we were just warming up the bed!” . 

i remember the younger brother drawing a lot on paper. maybe making horror comics? not sure.

i don’t remember the plot. but i remember white ish vomit. a witch/ghost/demon with white vomit. pretty sure it was a female. the white puke/foam wasn’t a big part of the plot or anything, it’s just something i remember.

i know that’s not much to go off of, but can somebody please tell me this movie existed and i’m not crazy!",0

"!! does anyone know the name of this movie? i watched this movie on netflix a good while ago and i cant remember the name at all and cant find it whenever i look up the plot of it.

it was set in the desert and this couple just moved into this nice house in the middle of no where to get away from the city (i think maybe one of them was an author?) and the guy starts finding voodoo/blair witch kind of dolls hanging from bushes/trees and skulls of animals around? i think he started having dreams about something as well? it was some guy/thing in a cloak doing it and the guy who found the doll things followed the cloaked man back to his house(?) and found his way into some catacomb type thing under the house and i think there was some ritual going on there? im not completely sure if this scene was in this movie, but i recall the guy going into town and asking some guy about it and he knew all about this witch man and his ritual.

"stephen king's: silver bullet (1985) [horror] [review] ""what the heck you gonna shoot a silver .44 bullet at anyway?""

the town of tarker's mills, a place where the people care about others the way they care about themselves. this is a pretty standard town within the realms of a stephen king story, wholesome hard-working american town. tarker's mills is affected by the grisly murders that are seemingly happening around town and the police service can't get a grasp on it. unsuspecting paraplegic hero, marty (cory haim) and sister jane (megan follows) start to piece together the puzzle after marty comes in contact with the evil that is conducting these murders during his own 4th of july celebration, add uncle red (gary busey) into this equation and you got a three piece ensemble ready to take this evil out. 

this film starts off pretty strong with a great kill scene before rolling into the set-up and atmosphere of the movie. it feels very familiar which is fine because the town is endearing during the sunny days while the kids are out playing and pulling pranks, though, when the sun goes down there is a mood drop and it feels a little ominous.

there is a little bit of a mystery involved that holds decently strong up until the reveal. the characters are fairly interesting, busey's character being the most interesting of the bunch, the child actors give pretty good performances with my favorite performance of the film coming from marty's best friend's father herb (kent broadhurst) in a chilling scene inside the local bar. this connects us quite handsomely to the characters of the story which helps build the tension later on. however, there is narration in this film from grown up jane (tovah feldshuh) telling the story as an adult that i found unnecessary, it helped set the scene at the beginning but the usage after that was baffling. it doesn't help or hurt the film but it's a personal qualm and doesn't do much for me in any film.


""holy jumped up bald-headed jesus palomino""

this is based off of stephen king's book ""cycle of the werewolf"", where the werewolf in that story made gutteral growls that accentuated almost humanistic tones and words. that sounds almost a little more chilling than what we get here in this film, that is not to say the beast in this film isn't effective but gives off more of a bearish vibe. i found keeping the werewolf hidden for most of the movie, where we see the claws go to work on a few victims was quite convincing, the usage of the baseball bat was a lot of fun. a few great human to beast transition scenes with practical effects that have to be some of the best i've seen in a werewolf movie. 

the direction of daniel attias made this film feel almost like a straight up made for tv movie, however, don coscarelli was set to direct this before backing out due to creative differences with producer dino de laurentiis so i can't help but beg the question, what if? 
all in all this is an enjoyable movie with some miscues and quirks, gary busey makes this a little more enjoyable than it should be but it works for what it is, among the werewolf movies out there this one should probably be closer to the top and for fans of stephen king and the world of werewolves this is a must see and would be a decent add to the collection.

i rate this movie 3.25 out of 5 stars

"find this movie i saw (part of) this movie when i was a kid in the 90s. i hardly remember anything about it except for the broad plot and one particular scene.

it is about a guy whose mother (or aunt?) was in a psychiatric institution. she escapes (or he brings her home, i don't remember) and lives with him in his house/apartment for a while. the guy then has a female friend (maybe his girlfriend) and the mother/aunt gets extremely hostile towards her. maybe the girl is just a cleaning woman, but she is definitely younger than the mother/aunt.

the scene i remember is this: there is an ironing board with a hot iron on it and the mother/aunt *freaks out* and attacks the young girl with the iron and burns her face with it.

some part of the plot is, i think, the mother/aunt repeatedly escaping from the psychiatric hospital ... really freaked me out when i was a kid.

"find this movie! hi. when i was in highschool, i had a boyfriend whose dad always wanted us to watch these really obscure horror films with us. one night he turned one on, it was fairly old. definitely not within the last decade. i remember it starting with a group of friends, they may have been on a road trip, stopping at some roadside attraction. i believe it was a gas station of some sort, but there was a horror attraction of some sort being added/opened inside it. the friends decide to try it out. i don't remember what happened next, but at some point this leads to them being trapped in this house. i believe that it was out in the middle of nowhere, really creepy shit. the people that lived there were very estranged, and i remember them being a family. i think one or two of the friends are killed, and the remaining try to escape. i remember them running around some sort of maze or labyrinth. it may have been outdoors (below ground or above), inside or below the house, something like that. i remember them getting caught, and the strange people (who seem sort of occult-like) crucify them or hang them or something in a field. i feel like may remember a scythe being involved. 

i'm not one hundred percent sure of a lot of this, but i'm absolutely desperate to figure out what that movie was. to this day, i remember it being the single most unsettling, horrifying thing that i have ever watched. if you know more, feel free to add something or ask me questions.

"chopping mall (1986) [mini review] ""thank you, have a nice day.""

a group of horny teenage employees at a shopping mall decide to throw an ol' pop and chips party inside after closing hours. there is a new form of security in this mall that malfunctions and ends up going on a killing spree with these teenagers trapped inside said mall.

not many covers have let me down as much as this one, as the synopsis on the back had me giddy to watch this. fantastic premise for a campy 1980s horror movie. was i ever disappointed. first of all, it's not a straight-slasher as you would be tricked into believing by the title. second of all, the killbots are dumb, and just shoot their stupid lasers all over the place. they arent menacing and seem to have to shoot approximately 10 laser beams to hit their target. the film felt like a broken down car just trying to chug along. got some decent performances in this with kelly maroney (alison) and tony o'dell (ferdy) but that's not really a concern with these types of movies, partial nudity is there, cheesy one-liners and the fantastic shlock is all there but just how silly the robots are and the squandered opportunity of a better film.

i understand what i'm watching , and this is not to be taken seriously as director jim wynorski intended so i do recommend checking this out at least once, this is a perfect movie to throw on with a group of friends who are looking for a good laugh, lover's of a 80s horror/sci-fi cheeseboard may chug right along with this broken down car but for me just a little too silly.

i rate this film 2.5 out of 5 stars

"possum 2018. disclaimer: this is strictly my opinion. if you disagree that's fine, lets have a civil discussion about it. 

on the suggestion of some people here i decided to check this out. i have to say, it wasnt for me.

david lynch is one of my favorite film makers of all time, and i do enjoy a healthy dose of surrealism, but it has to be done in a way that still keeps you engaged. some movies i've watched are just nonsense after nonsense and think they're being deep and edgey, (looking at you begotten) and that's fine if you're after a dose of nonsense, but there needs to be an overarching plot or convergence down the road that makes it all come together in a meaningful way.

now, this movie is kind of like napoleon dynamite. it doesnt seem to have much in the way of pacing, and a paper thin plot exists, but it meanders around so much that i got impatient. it's slow. to a fault. annoyingly slow.

to add to that, the only element of horror that i saw exist was a spider puppet. its creepy on it's own, but it's not enough to base a film on. there were also some balloons and random flashbacks that felt tacked on and pretentious.

it kind of felt like they had the puppet and then decided to build a movie around it. like hey, that looks creepy, maybe people will like it because the spider is so cool. to be fair, it is cool, but it stops having much effect and just gets tiresome.

full disclosure: i couldn't finish it. i tried watching and fell asleep about half way. when i came to about 30 minutes later i shut it off.

if you enjoy it, i'm glad. for me there wasnt much to love.

the movie, overall, was about a woman moving(alone) into a house. she is haunted by this (i believe it was demonic?) spirit that takes the form of a little girl.

the first memory i have doesn't help much, but i remember there being a seance of some sort, where it is learned the spirit has ill intentions and that the woman should leave.

if i remember correctly, she is in denial about the spirit having bad intentions. she can't seem to be able to let go of this spirit, like it's drawing her in.

i remember the movie ending with her having the ""little girl"" sitting on her lap and stroking her hair(?). the little girl then proceeds to murder the woman, while she is unable to see it coming.

any help figuring out this movie would help, i've been trying to figure it out for some time now.",0

"clive barker's: hellraiser (1987) [horror] ""he'll tear your soul apart""

hellraiser is a movie that i heard about in my youth, was told to not watch it until i reached a certain age. the vhs cover (along with many movies from this era), pinhead standing front and center holding lemarchand's box was enough to deter me for quite some time. the time seemed to have quickly come, as i was knee high in my favorite horror movies trying to build up the courage. 

i'm not too sure if i knew what happened after watching it the first time, i was just kind of scared and amazed at the makeup and practical effects, the brutality of it all. upon rewatching this film a few more times, i've not only realized that the makeup and effects are indeed something special but that the story is truly captivating and terrifying.

""you solved the box, we came. now you must come with us, taste our pleasures.""

hellraiser starts off with frank (sean chapman) in morocco, where he purchases a configuration box. this box contains a portal to the underworld in which frank unleashes after tinkering with it and solving its puzzle. larry (andrew robinson) and his wife julia (clare higgins) move into the house that was once occupied by frank, brother of larry, and his acts of sexual deviancy. julia soon reveals the secrets of frank and the house, and here we are introduced to the cenobites. the cenobites are the evil spirits of those who have solved the box in the past, and had their bodies ripped apart and trapped in this hell encapsulated inside.

""demons to some, angel's to others.""

these things are absolutely terrifying, the uncanniness of pinhead, the gimp bondage type leather clothing that they are dressed in, the hooks and chains, the mutilated body parts....the cenobite that chatters his teeth. these are what nightmares are made of and it is so effective. clive barker sets up the atmosphere perfectly that everytime they are on screen, i personally felt like i was in hell and maybe hell is not a place i'd like to experience.

there are obvious holes in the special effects and the sound quality, as the film was released in 1987, but most of the practical effects and makeup hold up surprisingly well and may be some of the best for it's time. there are moments that may look so out of date that they make you giggle, but that just plays into the charm of the whole experience.

you get some really good performances from pretty well everyone in the film but most notably are andrew robinson, clare higgins and ashley laurence. doug bradley is no question iconic in the role of pinhead, and his voice is second to none as he was a new face in the horror genre. this film is quite gory and is not recommended to a light or moderate horror movie watcher as special effects designer bob keen played around with some pain and pleasure concepts that brought us something different that wasn't neccesarily explored alot in horror movies previous to this. 

this is a truly terrifying movie, with a brilliant concept brought to life by absolute geniuses in the horror genre. i have to put this near the top of my favorite of all time list and i hope you feel the same. 

i rate this movie 5 out of 5 stars 
or
10 out of 10 

this is a movie every fan of the genre should have up on their shelf.

"ro zombies: 3 from hell (2019) [horror] ""free the three!""

3 from hell starts off with beautiful grainy,over-saturated film stock overlooking the road in which the three were gunned down ten years previous.
great intro into the aftermath of the murder trials. locals in support of the firefly family despite the ghastly murders. 


""whats the difference between a dead squirrel laying in the middle of the road and a dead clown laying in the middle of the road?
there is skid marks in front of the squirrel.""

sid haig turns in a great final scene of his career. the same old captain spaulding, as witty and sinister as ever. 

sherri moon zombie is bone chillingly convincing as a psychopath and may have put in her best efforts as an actor yet. she stays as beautiful as ever while putting in a captivating performance this time 'round as baby firefly.

""can't hustle the hustler""

foxy (richard brake) is a great addition to the family, in place of captain spaulding. he is a fantastic actor and plays the backwoods, overly vulgar character extremely well.

around the mid way point of the movie there is a sequence that feels as if rob zombie pays homage to his own film ""the devils rejects"" in a gruesome scene that allows the movie to succumb to the gore that we all expected. the conflict really starts to take hold with a wrap-around to the beginning of the film. these antagonists are not exactly frightening or scary but they surely are intimidating in a real life sense. they bring alot of gun warfare into a franchise that has found other unique ways to showcase it's gore. as there isn't as much practical effects in this as it's predecessors, it does make use with the cgi quite well and fits the atmosphere that this movie has, that is quite different than the others.

this flick has a fantastic soundtrack, some great camera work that uses brilliantly bright and vibrant colors throughout that fits the era in which this movie takes place. 

perfect ending to the firefly saga. concludes with some perfectly suited lines from otis and baby, along with a vile act that only members of this family would be able to perform

i rate this movie 4 out of 5 stars

8 out of 10 stars.

"lake mungo - thanks, reddit  i read here in reddit relatively recently someone say something good about the movie lake mungo. it interested me, because i have the movie downloaded for a while because of previous recommendations but when i tried to watch it with my family some years ago we were disappointed because it was a documentary.

tonight we were gonna watch a netflix movie which no one really wanted to watch, until it came to me to watch lake mungo. i played the movie and as it started i remembered that it was the documentary i should've deleted from my laptop but never got around to do it. i looked up about the movie and figured out it's not a documentary and is actually a well acclaimed psychological horror movie.

we watched and well, here i am. not only were the plot twists truly surprising, but the atmosphere of the movie was dark and somber, filled with grief. as the movie approached its last arch, things got scarier and scarier until that scene ,- yes you know what i'm talking about - alice's found footage. that was one of if not the most unsettling thing i have ever seen on a horror movie.

this movie is very sad, but it touched me personally because of the existential dread it carries. death is scary, perhaps the scariest thing, and this movie touches on that point very deeply. it's also ridiculously sad, and after it ended all i felt was melancholia and fear. to me, that means this movie was a supreme master piece of horror, one i found by mere chance.

the only thing i know which can heal the existential vacuum i feel is perhaps jacob's ladder, which is the same thing except it's the opposite in terms of the message it conveys.

if you lasted this long and didn't find this cringy, i hope you liked the movie as well as i did, and if you haven't watched yet, what the f\*ck are you doing here?

this movie haunted me deeply, and i don't want to forget it. i don't want to forget alice :(",0

"blair witch 2: book of shadows one of my guilty pleasure movies.

now, i know that it's not a popular one, and yes the acting is really hammy and cheesy in spots, as are the special effects and plot.

that said, i've been madly in love with this movie since i first saw it on its release. 

its a strange and daring follow up to the original, and it does something way different than most sequels do. it doesn't just rehash the first movie or try to continue the story in a hackneyed or meaningless way. it takes the first movie and acknowledges it's existence as a movie from within the movie. this adds a brilliant layer of depth to it that it wouldn't have had if it was just another found footage rehash.

the cast ranges from cheesy and cringeworthy (erica leerhsen) to exceptional, especially that of jeffrey donovan. kim director is amazing as well.

for fans of  movies with hidden content or easter eggs, you'll love this movie. it's got multiple hidden references and secrets to find.


it's far better than the imdb rating would suggest and is definitely worth a watch if you have never seen it or are a fan of the series.

for me, it could just be that it's a product of it's time, but i've always loved it and still give it a few watches a year at least. 

also check out the good back flicks episode based on this movie. it's an interesting watch and gives some insight as to what happened during the creation process to assify it.

"i want a movie to actually make me paranoid. (spoilers below) (spoilers) out of all the movies i have seen, these are the ones that actually affected me:

the conjuring: made me paranoid for like a week, and gave me a fear of being pulled from my feet when i'm sleeping. the whole 'someone watching you in the dark' aspect got me scared. 

sinister: only the snuff films within the movie made me scared of serial killers watching into your home. but it was ruined as soon as you figure out that the killer is a possesed child, and the ending turns to be very cliche. i think the movie would have been better if the person recording the films was an actual serial killer; that gives it a more realistic effect rather than some pagan ghost. 

paranormal activity: the only part of the movie that really got to me, and gave me chills, was when the boyfriend finds the old picture of the girlfriend in the attic. i find this aspect very creepy, and when horror gets involved with childhood memories, it screws with me, and makes me think of something like this happening to me. 

annebelle: creation: honestly, the only part that made me feel unsettled was when the (i cant exactly remember) girl who is possessed by the doll starts becoming deformed and outstretched, and begins to walk. the extremely long limbs and tallness of the figure was actually disturbing, and i never want to see it again. 

in conclusion, no movie has scared me fully throughout it. only certain points and aspects affect me. this includes:

\- posession

\-deformed figures

\-old films &amp; old pictures

\-childhood memories

\-tall, out stretched figures

if a movie were to include all these things, i think i would actually be scared. but my issue is that when some people would watch a horror movie, and talk about how they couldn't sleep after, or had nightmares for days. none of this happens to me at all. i want to feel something. i don't get scared. i don't know if anyone else feels this way, but i just can't find a movie to truly scare me. somebody please help me.",0
"need help remembering name of horror movie so it was a lesser known horror movie where a mail delivery man is on a delivery with his friend. he leaves his friend behind on his way to said delivery and falls asleep once he reaches the drop off point while waiting for the house owner to return. hot girls scare him awake and blah blah blah eventually an evil naked girl comes and kills most of them until some people come to their rescue who you find out are cultists. they take refuge in the cultists house because the evil girl cant get inside. shit goes down in the house and eventually they perform a ritual that is performed wrong from there i dont remember what happened....anyone know what im talking about? if i recall correctly, when the evil girl died the female cultist gives birth to a full grown version of the evil woman. also during the ritual a guy spits out blood at this girls face and her face melts.",0

**ju-on: the curse (2000)**

greatness from small beginnings! this made-for-tv movie is a bit low budget and the scares don’t always work because of it, but when they’re effective it is pretty easy to see why this spawned a franchise. the acting and camera work is generally too soapy to create any sense of lasting tension, but the moment-to-moment scares are definitely there, especially at the beginning (while there is still a sense of mystique. by the midpoint enough has been explained to make the film a bit less effective as a whole). all in all, not a great film but an okay one, and it is just the tip of the iceberg. **7/10.** 
**scare of the film:** kudos to the walkman scare in the second vignette, but the absolute best moment is the entire first vignette. it slowly ramps up the tension in a way that the rest of the film struggles at, with a fantastic use of sound and other-worldliness. the ending of the vignette hits a climax that helps set the tone that the rest of the film will follow.

**ju-on: the curse 2 (2000)**

it’s really surprising to me that the series continued past this point. there’s just something weird about having half your movie be a recap of the previous film, and the other half being . . . uh, well . . . bad? i’ll give it some credit: by moving a lot of the story away from the saeki house it doesn’t allow the viewer to feel comfortable or accustomed to their settings. however, the trouble is that none of the other locations are given enough time to become foreboding, meaning that the scares kind of come out of nowhere because we have no idea where the characters are running to or from (besides the obvious “running from a ghost”). the characters are, by and large, unlikable and less fun than the predecessor’s, and you never feel any need to root for any of them to do anything but die. it’s 45 minutes of new footage where none of it is all that great. **5/10**
**scare of the film:** none do as well as the early scares from *the curse*, but the scene at the country house comes quite close. i’m finding toshio far creepier than his mum, and this scene milks him for all he’s worth. couple that with hysterical laughter and doll babying, you’ve basically got a melting pot of creep.

**ju-on: the grudge (2002)**

to say that this is a significant improvement over the prior two films would be a pretty vast understatement. there is just so much that this film does better than its predecessors that i can’t list it all here. a higher budget, better actors, less in-your-face scares, better lighting and camerawork: these all help elevate the film. to me, however, the thing that carries it the most is its pacing. *the grudge* is perfectly paced for almost its entire runtime, with scares laid out in a consistent manner and tension being allowed to rise in between the climaxes. i say “almost” because, unfortunately, the last 15 minutes are far less fun, tense, or scary than the preceding hour and a quarter. it gets a bit too slow and a bit too weird all at once for my taste. either way though, leagues better than either of the previous films and actually makes me somewhat excited to watch the rest of the series. **9/10**
**scare of the film:** there are so many fantastic scares over the course of the film that it is hard to pick just one, however the one that sticks out the most is the quiet horror of the shot of the empty tokyo streets near the close of the film. it’s scary in an indirect fashion, but it is definitely the moment that stayed with me the longest.

**ju-on: the grudge 2 (2003)**

this was a weird movie. i honestly wish i had a lot more to say about it, but really that is the long and short of it. it continues the previous films’ tradition of slowly getting better acting and production values (i even *gasp* cared about a character this time around), it also ups the number of scares and is even pretty inventive and experimental at times. that being said, it is still a bit of a hot mess due to its reliance on being “not *ju-on: the grudge*.” so many rules and character motivations are changed or added in this movie, and the plot ends up being mostly incoherent and pretty not good as a result. even some of the best scares and characters so far couldn’t save this film from its most vengeful ghost: the ghost of the prior film. **7/10**
**scare of the film:** as stated, the film has quite a few good scares, but the two that really stuck out for me were the wig scene and, especially, the meta hospital scare from early in the film. good shit.

**the grudge (2004)**

i wish i could write two reviews of this. well, i guess i could, but i figure i won’t. see, the thing is this movie does a lot of things badly, a few things okay, and one thing really well (put down the pitchforks). because of this, overall it ends up being a bad movie (and the score will reflect that, don’t worry) but it also ends up being a lot of fun to tear apart. there are so many moments where the characters are so stupid or the writing and contrivances the movie takes to have all its cast be white but in japan that it’s, frankly, laughable. for instance, the character of peter says one line in english the entire movie but for some reason he was whitewashed from japanese to american. that one line is even spoken to a character he was just talking to in japanese. i just . . . don’t understand. anyway, all the most famous scares from the past four movies are here (with the least—possibly none?—being from *the curse 2* and the most being from *ju-on: the grudge*), none of them are as effective as the original versions due to over-reliance on cgi and almost everything being rushed in order to contain as many call-backs as possible. it does run as a “best of,” though, which can be sort of fun at times. the acting is pretty good mostly, the lighting and camerawork are serviceable at best and awful at worst but at the end of the day par for the course. i will give the movie one piece of credit: the change to the ending was a good thing. it leaves the film on a much more straightforward note, but it doesn’t have the slow-to-a-crawl the original had. points deducted for the excision of the creepy tokyo streets, though. **6/10**
**scare of the film:** since so many of the scares were from the previous films, it was hard to find something that hadn’t been done before. nonetheless, the scene inside the morgue was pretty well-executed and a neat surprise for people familiar with the series.

**the grudge 2 (2006)**

well, they certainly didn’t fix any of the remake’s problems. i figure i’ll start with the good this time: uh . . . well . . . the lighting was better? the remixing of some of the old scares rather than just simply copying them was neat, i guess? yeah, that’s about it. the acting was terrible (worst in the series thus far), the plot added too many new pieces to the mythology which in turn made it far less scary, the movie had zero tension, the editing was abysmal . . . should i go on? even the few scares the movie did have were either directly copied from a previous film (thankfully far less than the first american *grudge* film) or were, as stated above, remixes to “subvert expectations.” but even that doesn’t really matter because without any tension or build up all the scares just end up falling flat. the film also feels like it is two plots squashed into one, with the principal but far less interesting plot being the one set in japan (with a bunch of bumbling white people stumbling on clues that help lessen the impact of the mystery and mythology of the series) and the secondary and far more interesting plot being about a family in chicago, that really has basically nothing to do with any of the other films or the grudge mythos in general until the last five minutes, which tells me that it was probably an unrelated idea until someone thought that the new *grudge* movie was looking a bit thin and decided to push a second plot into it to beef it up a bit. anyway, *the grudge 2* is terrible. can’t wait for *the grudge 3* to rock my world . . . **5/10**
**scare of the film:** literally no scares work in this movie, but i guess if i have to choose one it would be the love hotel. why? mostly because it got rid of a pretty annoying character, it was kind of inventive maybe a little, and i thought it was funny that a movie set in japan contrived a reason for two characters to go to a love hotel. gotta find ways to show americans how weird and wacky japan is, how else will you get bums in seats if not with false stereotypes?

**the grudge 3 (2009)**

this film is literally unwatchable. the characters are all unlikeable, the acting and writing are both like watching cantaloupes try to be human, the plot is pretty inconsequential, has pretty contrived connections to the larger mythos, takes an hour to get off the ground (making this a “slow burn horror movie,” too bad there’s no horror), and uh, yup that’s about it. it’s “kind of” a remake of *ju-on: the grudge 2* and not that it’s a masterpiece of filmmaking either but i would certainly watch it 100 times over before i subjected myself to this again. i’m glad these remakes are over, get me back to japan. **0/10**
**scare of the film:** this is getting harder and harder as each film recycles and reuses the same 5 scares and somehow makes them less effective overtime by making the overall atmosphere less scary and tense. if i really have to pick one (which i guess i do), the hair brushing scene was alright. at least it had toshio in it, which is something this movie had a pretty bad drought of otherwise.

**ju-on: black ghost (2009)**

i was very excited for this one. i’ve always been a big fan of long-running series that find new ways to reinvent themselves by tossing out some of the baggage and leaving only the best aspects (like *halloween iii* and *a new nightmare*, for instance). this approach truly benefits *ju-on* as well. that isn’t to say that *black ghost* isn’t without its flaws—in fact from a technical and production standpoint this is among the worst of the series, right there with *the curse 1+2* with all its campy, soapy glory—but they are superseded by a refreshingly inventive story with a new villain, great twists and turns, and a fast-paced, snappy, plotline. some of it continues to be recycled (*black ghost* cribs extensively from *ju-on: the grudge 1+2*), but at least there are some inventive uses of recycling and even some great new scares. it all wraps up in probably the best (and most devastating/ devastatingly beautiful) ending of the series thus far. **8/10**
**scare of the film:** there are a few fantastic ones that callback and crib from previous films but in really inventive ways, but i think i’ll go with the more original scene at the house at night late in the film. it ties the plot together nicely but unexpectedly, with the last minutes feeling like a beautiful epilogue after the scares that came before. to get that effect, they needed to stick that final tie with some really great scares, and they deliver.

**ju-on: white ghost (2009)**

that went from zero to one hundred really fast. honestly, i loved *white ghost*, and feel comfortable saying that it is the best *grudge* film since *ju-on: the grudge*. for one thing, it is extraordinarily well acted. this movie deals with some heavy subject matter and the cast handles it masterfully. which brings me to my second love for this movie: the fact that it turns everything about the previous films on its head. this film is less about scary ghosts and more about scary people, how some of the most terrifying actions happen behind closed doors and not in the pages of a ghost story. it’s darker and more twisted than any of the other films and is just better for it. most of these movies don’t feel dark enough and this one cranks it up to eleven. and the scares, oh man the scares. there are fewer here than in *black ghost* (the easiest to compare it to since they are basically a self-contained duology within the larger mythos), but they are almost all very new and very inventive. in fact, i think i only saw a single repeat scare in this film (repeated from american *the grudge 2*, of all places), and even it is still just different enough to be a bit of a shock when it happens. the rest are extremely effective at building tension—there are almost no jump scares in *white ghost*—and often go for more of a “long con”-type approach, slowly building unease and dread in the audience and giving no true release. this is effective in its own right but is especially effective in a series where i was starting to get really tired of “quick buck”-type scares. my only gripe with *white ghost* (since i have to have one) is that it borrows just a little too much from the other j-horror series westerners are most familiar with: *ringu*. i could have done without some of the cribbing from it, but at least it is still unique to *the grudge*. **9/10**
**scare of the film:** i want to be like “they’re all really good!” but truthfully the only contender is the first vignette. it just knocks everything else out of the park, and i don’t mean just from *white ghost*; i mean from the whole series. so far, it is the scare to beat. pure gold.

**ju-on: the beginning of the end (2014)**

i’ll give it this: this is the better of the two *ju-on: the curse/ ju-on: the grudge* remakes for most of its runtime. it replays the major story beats from those two movies, but completely changes the role of many of its characters and (thankfully) invents many new moments of horror without reusing all the hits. it even gives an increased focus on toshio, who is the most interesting of the central ju-on ghosts and delivers many of the best scares of the series. the movie is also well produced, acted, and directed. unfortunately, it is also extraordinarily dull. for an hour and a half long movie, *beginning of the end* drags hard, with many sequences overlong and not tense or scary at all. when the scares do come, they are so often of the easiest and most cliché jump-scare variety that they hardly elicit a response from a seasoned horror movie viewer. toshio is similarly half-baked—yes, he is a far more central ghost this outing, but it is also not the same toshio as before. those creepy cat noises? gone. his crouching at the edge of the screen and in corners? gone (mostly). his really otherworldly interactions with the living? also mostly gone. he’s just sort of . . . there. it hardly ever feels like he’s the mischievous little boy i loved from the other films. what’s even stranger about this remake is that it changes the basic design of the house: something that has stayed consistent since day one. and yes, this was a negative in some ways, but the new design just feels wrong. it isn’t claustrophobic like the original, and it never feels like a real haunted house, more like a studio executive’s idea of a haunted house. for the faults i found with the original design, at least it felt like a real place that people would want to live in. this doesn’t, really. it’s a bit hard to explain. finally, the ending. this movie, hands down, features the worst ending of the three films (those being *ju-on: the grudge*, *the grudge*, and *the beginning of the end*), literally pulling out every cliché imaginable in a bid to be “scarier” and “more shocking.” absolute shite of a closing. **6/10**
**scare of the film:** as said above, even though many of the scares are new most are pretty bad, but one that does stand out is the milk scene. it was weird and a bit confusing, but at least it managed to elicit a bit of surprise from me and maybe even made me jump a little.

**ju-on: the final curse (2015)**

“if you can’t say anything nice, don’t say anything at all.” guess i better find something nice to say then . . . hmmm. okay, well, the way the adapted new toshio into something closer to old toshio was great! it was the only good thing about this film. everything else was dogshit. acting, writing, direction, character arcs, scares, lighting, music, even the set dressing was bland, uninspired, boring, repetitive, and well . . . dogshit. the story line was so jumbled that i literally think they broke the footage up into five-minute chunks and threw darts to decide placement of events. if anyone asked me what the chronological order of events in this movie was, i would probably cry uncontrollably from the sheer stress of trying to make any sort of guess. it’s only other saving grace is that it is slightly better than *the grudge 3*, in that between this and a frontal lobotomy i would only pick a frontal lobotomy ninety-nine times out of a hundred. **1/10**
**scare of the film:** i have nothing. no scare in this junk was memorable or interesting in any way. instead i’m going to randomly pick one: the subway scene. yup. let’s go with that.

**sadako vs kayako (2016)**

i’m super happy we got sadako vs. sadako’s clone. all joking aside, i am a huge fan of the original *ringu* (but i haven’t seen any of the sequels, maybe i’ll have to marathon review them sometime) and i was pretty pumped to get a break from all the nonsense that the *ju-on* series had been delivering me. i mean, a break is exactly what this film gave me, so i guess for that alone it gets a ton of brownie points. this is pure b-movie schlock but it knows that it’s b-movie schlock, with the main cast mostly acutely aware of the “urban legends” of sadako and kayako. this ends up making for some fun moments, with characters commenting on the relevance of vhs and some of the more “out there” ways these curses have been removed in the past, which all leads to a somewhat unsatisfying final fight but with a ton of enjoyment to be had from the absurdity of it all. it also has a great cast for a ju-on film, with actors that really bring a lot of humour and levity to the proceedings and honestly bring a decent amount of depth to their characters for such a short movie. masanobu ando in particular does a great job as the town’s resident ghostbuster—but then again, i am definitely biased because he was my favourite part of *battle royale*. in short, it’s a great movie. not very scary, mind, but a lot of fun for fans of either (or both) franchise. **8/10**
**scare of the film:** the movie isn’t particularly scary, but the introduction to the grudge house from the perspective of the four kids is a lot of fun and reminded me of something out of a batman comic.",0
why do you watch horror movies? i watch horror movies because i find it interesting what people are afraid of and what people believe others are afraid of. i live a very quiet life and never encounter anything close to horror. i enjoy trying to scare myself and conquering it. i enjoy investing into the scares (if they’re good ones). i also enjoy that horror movies take risks for what is allowed to be shown to an audience opening windows for other genres. i watch horror movies because i guess i love being scared for some strange reason lol,0
don't know if this is how others do well with horror movies but this is how i do it i don't use my imagination,0

"help finding a trailer and movie i’m 20, and a huge fan of horror movies. i remember a trailer for a movie coming out some time before 2009. i remember the trailer really freaking me out, being younger than 9 at the time. it’s a really vague memory but i remember a girl falling off a banister in slow-motion as well as the trailer having muse’s “our time is running out” playing throughout.

edit: to be more specific, i’d say that the trailer/movie probably came out between 2005-2009. around the times of “one missed call” (the movie i originally thought it came from), and “sorority row”. also the song might not have definitely not been “our time is running out” but had a similar vibe and sound. this might just be a wild goose chase and thus i will be forever haunted but goddamnit i’m gonna try. thanks for y’alls support.

2nd edit: okay. the song was definitely sixx am’s “life is beautiful”.

3rd edit: okay. so, as originally thought, the movie was 100% one missed call (2008). however i’ve been scouring the internet for hours and can not find it. i know i should be happy that i have connected all the dots together, but for some reason i just really want to watch the trailer again. the only use of both song and trailer together was for television advertisements only. i’m going to cross post some more. of any of you find the link please send it my way, to help me from being forever haunted. much love. 💙",0

1. the body. i loved the tone in this film. it's kind of a mishmash of dorky comedy, noir, and slasher. it's actually pretty good at each one of these, though the ending felt a little... eh. overall really good and entertaining. 7/10

2. flesh and blood. this felt a lot like another little gem i saw recently, the clovehitch killer. it's about a girl with agoraphobia who starts suspecting her father of sinister activity. it's mostly well done, with dermot mulroney stealing the show easily with his quick bi polar shifts between good/bad, both of which he plays very well. the daughter was all over the place acting wise but overall passable. there was lots of really intense parts that i enjoyed as well. the conclusion was good, even if a little predictable, but it was overall entertaining. 6.5/10.

3. pooka! man this was all over the place and weird. it had elements from donny darko, jacob's ladder and even the surrealist absurdity of death to smoochy. i think i love the idea of this film more than the film itself, but for me the jacob's ladderesque ending makes the whole experience stick. so, opposite of the others, the overal movie needed some work, especially in the second and third act where it kind of starts wearing itself out, but the ending tied it together nicely. surreal, creepy in parts, but hard to take seriously sometimes. i love the art, but feel sometimes it's a little meandering. 6/10.

overall, 5 bags of popcorn and 2 sodas. i'm excited to see what this brings and hope that more anthology horror is on the way in the future.",0
"hampshire: a ghost story (2009) first time posting. i've been attempting to locate this movie for a few years now on my spare time to no avail. i saw this a couple times perhaps ten years ago on some horror site that i can't remember the name. might have been chiller or something similar. has anyone else seen this? if so where can i find it to stream, rent or buy?

here's the synopsis: there's a chef who works at a resteraunt. he's an average guy who has two twin guy friends he hangs out with. there's an abandoned housing complex above the place where he and his buddies go to get drunk one night after hearing something about the place bring haunted. they end up urinating in the corner of one of the rooms which literally pisses of the ghostly residents of the place. there's a scare and they leave but they are followed by a spirit. he constantly is followed and sees these things and they mess his life up. he ends up moving and starting over but that doesn't last long before they catch up to him. eventually he ends up back at the resteraunt to attempt to get rid of the menace one and for all. spoilers* it doesn't go well.

there are many of these but i'll only touch on a couple of them.

this house has people in it: fucking amazing. incredibly creepy and befuddling. it's just what it is with no explanation, and what it is is simply one of the best and most effective pieces of horror i've ever seen. very lynchian, and very unsettling. watch it.

unedited footage of a bear: i love this one too. evidently it has direct connections with a webseries called alan tutorial, but i'm personally not familiar with that. it's one of those artsy short films that i'm sure has a deeper message, but whatever it is i don't care. fucking amazing, watch it.

for profit online university: this is one of those existentially creepy and technophobic peices that i totally dig. it looks like it's a rag on colleges, which it is, indirectly, but more than that it's a criticism about online culture and the prevalence of ads online. all i can say is watch it. 

too many cooks: take jason vorhees and mix in equal parts full house theme song, and this is what you get. created by casper kelly, the same person who wrote mandy. that's gonna be a name to watch out for.

"tremors 1990 i love this film.

haven't seen it in years and decided to check it out after coming across red letter medias video on it.

i saw it once when i was young, probably 20 years ago or so, and enjoyed it. it's cheesy, over the top, and at the same time pretty intense. 

what i didn't realize is the amazing way the cinematic shots in the movie are done, and they still hold up today. well, mostly. there's one superimposed shot that's incredibly obvious and kind of bad, but other than that all of the special effects are pretty amazing. 

it does very well what many other movies fail at, being funny and intense at the same time. it's hard to pull off horror/comedy effectively without one retracting from the other, but tremors pulls it off rather well.

i'm sure many of you have already seen this, but if not then go watch it. the production quality and acting are top notch, and hold up better than many movies coming from this era.

yeah, its schlocky, but sometimes that's a good thing.

"pledge 2018 [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6220752/](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6220752/)  


man what a disappointing mess. this film has a fairly high score on rotten tomatoes, and i'm not really clear as to why. 

this film starts out looking and feeling like an american pie meets porkies comedy, that is, full of crude humor, and nerds trying to get laid and unrealistically attractive females. that doesn't last long though, and the film takes a turn into something that feels akin to a torture flick when they find a highly exclusive stonecutter-esque frat house that they want to pledge to. it's kind of like would you rather, in the sense that they are submitting to the treatment semi willingly in hopes of gaining something out of it. the ""pledges"" must submit to things like being branded, or eating disgusting food or what have you in order to gain access to the exclusive frat or ""social club"" as they call it.

i don't mind this, the setup isn't bad, the idea is there, but it's not done well. now, for me, there's a fine line between horror and comedy, and when something tries to be horror and fails, it comes off to me as funny. final destination, for example, is probably one of the funniest slapstick comedies i've ever seen. i don't think i've ever laughed harder at a movie than when the pane of glass falls on the dude and he squirts all over the sidewalk like somebody dropped a water balloon.

to start my long list of criticisms, it's too short. the ""horror"" parts are there, but are way too short to build tension. there are only a few instances with any sense of intensity and horror, and the acting in these parts is so bad that it turns into borderline comedy. at a run time of an hour and 17 minutes, i don't feel like the horror is long enough or frequent enough to make a lasting impact. 

there are twists in the story, but they're just tossed in, never really explored, never fleshed out, they're just there to be there, and the they're gone, and feel nearly inconsequential to the story. there was one part with what's supposed to  be a ""shocking reveal"" that's entirely beside the point and not really brought up again in any context until the very end. they could have stripped this out and expanded on the horror sections to make the movie more effective. the twist doesn't change the overall story at all, like, the antagonists don't have different behavior at all after learning this new information. the whole thing is a mess and feels very amateur.

i think the thing that holds it back the most is the acting. the lead character and main antagonist are really difficult to take seriously. they're either screaming cheesily and ham-fistedly or under-reacting in the given situations. i always feel that when somebody is doing their job as an actor, you can't tell that they're acting. now, almost everyone in this film misses that mark. it almost feels like they were aware that they were in a bad movie and were purposely hamming it up. 

&amp;#x200b;

i don't know. ifc films are hit or miss, but when they're hitting i feel that they're pretty good. this one wasn't a hit. the first half is kind of funny, and the horror parts are as well, but by the second half you'll stop caring enough to even laugh at how bad it is.

"can anyone recommend a killer movie for me? i love 80s horror and my knowledge of it is very limited.  i'm looking for something nostalgic, b movie, gory or not, either is fine.

i'll throw some titles out to give you guys an idea of what i'm looking for. it doesnt necessarily have to be from the 80s, but i tend to like that decade the best in terms of the horror's atmosphere and vibe.  i also love practical effects with a set design that's impressive.  again, the atmosphere of a movie to me is super important.

hellraiser (1987)
the curse (1987)
the thing (1982)

"the vanishing 2018 also called ""the keepers,"" this is a film based on an old gaelic mystery, which i can't say much more about without giving away plot. 

this movie is classified as a mystery/thriller, but regardless it has one of the most insane and toe curling kills i've seen in a long time. it has more blood and a higher body count than a lot of recent horror films as well, but i digress.

this movie takes a spaghetti western, mixes in texas chainsaw, and adds in character driven drama all at once. 

gerard butler is arguably the lead character, and does a really good job at conveying the appropriate emotions in his scenes. the rest of the cast does as well, especially the old salty sea captain, who reminds me of bryan cranston if he was doing an impression of mr. krabs.

anyway about 2/3 of the way in everyone starts turning on each other and everything turns into anarchy.

the biggest issue i have with the film is how fucking slow it is. it's an hour and 40 or so minutes long, but really it takes nearly 50 fucking minutes before it gets moving.

anyway, if you have time, look into it. it's well made and well acted, but it's boring as shit in the beginning.

"bird box yes i know there is a thread two posts down, but fuck it, i'm making this here anyway. 

i just watched this film after hearing about it everywhere i look, despite it having sandra bullock. 

overall i enjoyed it. i like the movies that have a theme of the world ending in various ways. it's fascinating from a sociological aspect to see what would happen to people if they get torn from their comfort zone and thrust into a survival situation. this movie nails it i think. some would hole up and be grumpy assholes, some would lie and steal and fuck like nothing mattered anymore, and yet others would keep hope alive and try to make the best of the situation. none of them are right or wrong, its all just different ways of dealing with the same situation. 

the characters were amazingly well done and acted, even bullocks character. i expected a shitty, wooden performance from her like in her romcoms or dramas, but i think she does well in this movie, and  the fact that i can't find much bad to say despite looking pretty fucking hard is a testement to how well she did.

so the concept of the film is kind of an odd mix. it reminds me of pontypool, but it's a sight virus rather than an audio one. it also has tinges of lovecraftian cosmic horrors, in the vain that you can't lay eyes on these.... things or you go crazy. there's also the added layer of having to stay blind. i like this twist but i feel like it could have been used more to ratchet up tension, like hiding in a tent and having the creeps or creatures or whatever outside and being oppressive, like the scene in blair witch. alternatively, some first person or even found footage style shots would have been amazing as well. i also kind of feel like the birds, who are a namesake of the film, didn't come into play as often as they should have.

i liked that there was no explanation. it's just doom, and it's coming, and nobody seems to know why or ask why. it just is. i feel like that's good enough and that it doesn't need to be any more than that. like myers or jason, its an unstoppable force that exists and you have to conform to it and not the other way around.

also props to charlie, the unsung cowardly hero who saved the crew by jumping on the veritable sword. i was afraid his character was gonna be the token black comic relief character, like anthony anderson usually is, but he wasn't. he was an intelligent, useful person who just happened to let his fear get the better of him. can't say i'd be much better than him. 

now downsides. i didn't like how it hopped around randomly. i feel like if the story was told in order beginning to end, it would be much more effective. the cuts to the past and present seemed to happen willy nilly and the places it happened didn't serve any narrative purpose. i feel like they could have even padded out both ends and made two films out of it, cutting between where the two met. 

regardless, it gave me a good feeling, like the mist did, and even a quiet place, though i feel a quiet place was a lot more effective at dealing out the tension. also for me it felt quite a bit like a shyamalan film.

anyway, i'm getting long winded, but it was an entertaining film and one i'd hang up as being good, even with a few flaws, kind of like the visit or even signs.

7.5/10. watch it when you have time.",0
"rust creek 2018 so this one came out of nowhere for me. 

it's kind of a cross between 10 cloverfield lane (the good parts of the movie) and eden lake.

a girl gets into trouble with some rednecks after leaving for a job interview and being led in the wrong direction by her gps.

i have never heard of the vast majority of the cast outside of the sherriff who is played by one of those prolific character actors that's been in 100+ films but you can never remember their name, who i'm fond of calling ""oh it's that guy,"" but they all do a mostly good job outside of a few scenes where the lead seems to be a little too complacent about her situation. 

this falls into one of my favorite genres of horror, which is bad shit that people do to each other. it's creepy for me because things like this actually happen. this one does nothing new perse, but it does it well regardless. 

one thing that's of note in this film is that the lead actress comes across as being intelligent and competent given her circumstances, a stark contrast to the stupid and incompetent damsel in distress trope that's in many horror films. which upon writing i actually looked up the writer of this film to see if it was written by a female. yep. written by julie lipson and directed by jen mcgowan. keep an eye on them.

if you run across this give it a watch, it has a lot of tense moments and is surprisingly well made given it's smallish budget, and is overall pretty good despite not doing much of anything new.

"the witch? (and similar movies) hey folks,

what’s the verdict on the witch (or the vvitch i guess if we wanna get into that)? i’ve seen many horror fans love it while more casual moviegoers hated it, and i’m wondering if its worth the watch.

i watched hereditary yesterday and it was quite good (particularly the cinematography), but a little more conventional than i expected. i’m a big fan of artistic films and have read up on the witch enough to understand that its artistry and focus on atmosphere rather than outright horrific imagery may be why so many casual horror fans didn’t care for it. 

so, what do you people on this wonderful sub think, or is there a better place to ask—is the witch overrated or was it really a groundbreaking horror film? are there any other films like it (along with hereditary, a quite place, and the babadook) that i might enjoy? i’m looking for stuff preferably more visually frightening than the babadook, but a little less conventional than hereditary.

"black mirror: bandersnatch this is a hard one to review since it isn't really done in a standard way. it's a good thing, dont get me wrong, but it is much more difficult is all.

it's damn near impossible to talk about this without giving away a series of events at multiple times in this interactive film, so i won't talk about the plot, at all.

what i will say is that they got a lot of the 80s and super nerdy programming aspects of this film spot on, even down to the music and some of the coding errors on the zx spectrum. the atmosphere is out of this world.

throughout experiencing this, there were 2 films that kept popping into my head, 1 beind jacobs ladder, 2 being donnie darko. i can't say too much of why, but play around with your choices and you'll find out on your own, but it definitely feels like it takes cues from both of these.

the only real downside i can think of is that some characters were incredibly underutilized. some characters were fucking cool and i wanted to see more of them.

i love black mirror, and while some of the individual episodes are misses, all of them are thought provoking. it's never afraid to push boundaries and try new things, and i applaud them for that and hope that more people try to innovate this way.

9/10

a word of warning, if you are one of the types of people that likes to find ""alternative"" ways to watch your films, dont do that here. you need to experience this on netflix. if you get an alternative version, you'll get a mess of random scenes that don't stitch together well, and will be left confused and turned off from the film, so don't fucking bootleg this film.

"the farm 2018 this is a weird one.

it feels like a very well made low budget movie.

some scenes have the typically bad acted feel to them, but other scenes look like they were filmed by someone who knows what they're doing, so it's an overall mixed bag.

so, a couple on a road trip make a stop in rural usa, (it just dawned on me how many horror movies start this way) and wake up in cages on a farm where people are cooking other people for food. there is an obvious message here, especially when you look up the directors past works and see that he made a film aboit barbecuing pigs with a big peta logo on the cover, but honestly i'm not interested in the politics behind it. 

the acting is mostly bad, with some decent acting that feels accidentally thrown in once in a while. the one standout on both ends of the spectrum is the inkeeper guy with the crooked face. he has some scenes that are really well done and some that are awkward and god awful. 

also worth mentioning is the warbley, distorted country music that's playing on the ""farm"". it was a nice touch and definitely adds to the uncomfortableness.

at its core, t's a shock film, plain and simple. if you're into films that are created solely to shock and disgust you, you might like it. if you aren't, stay the fuck away.

"end of the year... a few films that i squeezed at the end of the year i feel are worth mentioning. 

1. *assassination nation* - slick, fun, tense, well written, fantastic cast, with direction, editing, sound, and camera work that made me just fall for this flick. not since the early guy richie flicks have i seen something this slick and polished. it sort of has a message, but that did not turn me off, if anything i found myself yelling ""fuck yeah"" at those moments.

2. *surveillance* a bit older, had never heard about it, figured i'd give it a shot and was not disappointed at all. wickedly twisted flick about the investigation of some active killers on a spree. honestly, not a fan of quite a few of the cast, but they certainly make this film work on many levels. 

3. *bird box* - i've seen love and hate for this flick. personally i loved it. i felt the non-linear story was an excellent way to tell this story. the cast, directing, shooting, and writing, for me worked very well. i love a good monster flick and it's hard to find one that's very engaging anymore. they're either hackneyed and painful, or just cheap money grabs. this, for me, was a very engaging story.

4. *into the dark* (tv show) - i have to hand it to the production staff here, itd has been on a level of twilight zone or black mirror with each episode (have admittedly only seen 3). incredible cast and writing go a long way. the hour long stories each have been their own self contained tale that are wonderfully unsettling and compelling.

5. *the terror* - wow. a fictionalised tale of the disappearance of the hms erebus and hms terror. the depth of this is on a level that you rarely see. this study in fear, and how the crews deal with it on a many levels is truly an amazing work. very few things have ever been this engaging so consistently.

"i’ve recently rewatched my favorite stephen king movie, ‘ storm of the century ‘ i feel like i need to vent. mainly because of the towns people. 

this movie proves there is a heaven and hell, yet the town folks go against michael anderson and decide to give the devils demon a child


idk about you, but if heaven and hell is proven i can think of no better rally cry to fight against a demon.  

giving up a child is damnnation and i fear the towns folk will end up in hell for their decision.

"krampus 2015 i feel it's probably time to cover a christmas movie, so, here it is.

this movie is fun, it's entertaining and has a great cast, but i feel like the humor is hit and miss.

the cast is what holds this up for me, specifically the always beautiful and talented toni collette and david koechner, with a special nod to the drunken aunt, conchata ferrell, who was much funnier than she should have been.

there is a few parts that were hard to sit through and were overall misses, but there were also parts that were hilarious and made me want to keep watching.

overall, black christmas is a much better christmas movie and horror movie, but this one is a fun watch, at times.

"the clovehitch killer 2018 this movie was surprisingly good, and had a surprisingly slow setup, but was ultimately worth the time invested.

this film centers around a  family in a very reserved, repressed and sheltered church community of ambiguous faith. the son finds some things that he finds suspicious and launches his own independent investigation. 

i can't go much more into detail than that without giving away a ton of plot, but i will say that it's very... honest in its storytelling. 

the movie was straightforward, no jumpscares, dishonest plot twists or tryhard shock moments to speak of, and even without those things it still manages to be incredibly honest and disturbing in its storytelling. take note, hollywood, this is a perfect example of how to make effective horror with no gratuitousness.

it's more pf a thriller/drama than horror, but honestly, its close enough to cause debate so who gives a shit.

the cast does a pretty good job of playing their perspective parts, though i feel like there were a few characters that were very underutilized. the lead character gets a little sullen and wooden at a few points in the film but his performance is mostly passable. 

7.5/10 watch it when you can, and avoid spoilers.

"night shift 2018 this is an irish movie with a mostly unknown cast.

a college girl is starting a new job at a hotel working the overnight shift in a hotel with a dark past.

its quite a bit like the innkeepers, but kind of a lite version, and just as cliche ridden as you would think given the description of the movie.

the movie starts out with a bang, and then there isn't much happening in the following 40 or so minutes of the film, and after that it just snowballs into a bunch of weirdness pretty quickly, where it takes a hard left turn into something similar to 1408 meets triangle.

the big drawback for me is how heavy-handed it gets in the second half. all the subtlety and subliminality (it's a word if i say it is) flies out the window. it lays everything on so thick that the supernatural becomes the status quo, which in turn makes it lose all creep factor.

it manages a couple of decent spooks towards the beginning, but nothing that would cause me to sleep with the lights on.

entertaining, sort of, but not spooky in the slightest.

"webcast 2018 it's better than i thought it would be. 

this is a british film, so it might be hard for yankees like me to understand without turning it way up or having subtitles on.

webcast is largely filmed as a hybrid guerrilla style found footage film, with the majority of the movie filmed by the lead actresses camera, first person style. there are many shots that jump back out into third person, mostly because the scenes wouldn't make any sense if the cameras were running at those times, and they needed the shots for story advancement. that's fine, but for me it should stay 90% one way or the other, because each shift in perspective tends to break my immersion.

the story is strange, kind of a hybrid of blair witch and dial m for murder. many of the plot elements are predictable and even a little eye rolling, but overall the story is effective and manages to build some tension. it's kind of a cross between a murder mystery and an occult film, kind of like kill list. anyway it's an interesting combination that each element lends well to the other to create good atmosphere. 

the lead actress does a passable job, and never feels too fake or exaggerated, as is her boyfriend. 

absolutely worth a watch, even though it doesn't do anything particularly new. 6.5/10.

"the nun 2018 first and foremost i want to say that i'm not a fan of the conjuring series. i find them to be holywood money makers and they are largely devoid of content or scares.

with that out of the way, this movie was incredibly well made. the acting was really good, especially that of taissa farmiga. the rest of the cast does a pretty good job as well. 

i went into the movie thinking i would hate everything about it, but i was pleasantly surprised with how atmospheric and well put together it is. something about catholicism mixes well with horror i think, and has since the exorcist. 

the set design was well done too. for me, there's nothing more creepy and fascinating than organized religion, and all of the convent set pieces were beautifully made.

which brings me to the downsides, which can all pretty much boil down to one problem: its just not scary. it could be that i'm a jaded old asshole who doesn't get spooked anymore, but this movie felt like a series of roaring monsters, attacking corpses and jumpscares... just predictable and boring.

still, worth a watch for taissa farmiga and for the imagery, atmosphere and set design, but its just not scary.

"malevolence 2018 this was very.... mediocre.

a brother and sister team up and scam people as ""ghost hunters"" that are able to ""put ghosts to rest."" they run into a particular residence with a dark history and things go downhill quick.

the film dips between boring and semi interesting, but never stays interesting for too long. there are many parts that feel like an unneeded waste of time and don't add to the story. that said, there were some creepy and even some gory moments that lead up to a welcome conclusion. it's kind of like the possession of michael king meets stir of echoes. 

the acting was mostly good, with the siblings being the standouts, especially from the lead girl florence pugh.

watch it if you're bored. theres nothing new or boundry pushing here, but its still an ok watch, i guess.

"hell house 1/2 i generally like found footage style films because they are immersive. sometimes more so than a traditional filming style if done right.

the original hell house was just ok to me, a series of cheap startles masquerading as ""scares"" and parading as intensity and atmosphere. i know many people touted hell house 1 as the second coming of blair witch, but for me it was only ok. 

the second hell house feels really similar, but with a lot pf unneeded cheese and padding in the start of the film. once ot starts moving it's a lot of the same, loud noises and startles parading as substance. the one highlight for me was the ultra cheesy psychic dude that had the personality of a game show host. he was great.

the problem i have with a lot of found footage films is that they often rely on that one sole gimmick to hold up the entire movie, and once you strip that away, you're left with hollow, tropey characters, a paper thin plot, and almost nothing that would make it even watchable, let alone good. jumpscares for the sake of jumpscares are not enough to hold up a film.

anyway, this movie sucked. the performance of the lead character is all over the map, ranging from just ok to comedically horrible, and the other voices/sounds are incredibly awkward and feel jammed into the film haphazardly.

"the collector just got around to watching the collector last night.  i thoroughly enjoy horror movies, but never find them “scary” (first candyman aside), but there was about a 30 minute section of that film where i was genuinely creeped out- the section between where he asks the woman in the bathtub to scream to distract the collector to when he tortured her in the bathtub was quite tense and well done.  the collector’s mask is also pretty unnerving (reminiscent of deckers mask in nightbreed).


the main character kept making really dumb decisions and the traps became too elaborate and it devolved into a bit of silliness, which took a lot of the tension out toward the end, but i would recommend it to fellow horror fans for the middle section of they haven’t seen it yet.

"need help finding name of late 80s/early 90s movie!  

hello!

there was a movie i saw only the beginning of when i was in first grade, about 1991/92. i snuck out of my room to watch it secretly as my parents were watching it.  i only saw the first part of the movie, but it scared me so i am assuming it would fall somewhere in the 'horror' genre.

&amp;#x200b;

it started showing a tall skyscraper like building in a big city, something like new york. inside one of the top floors a man in a suit walks into his office and sets a briefcase on the desk. behind the desk is a wall of giant windows overlooking the city. in the shadows near the door the man entered is another man, possibly also wearing a suit. i'm not positive, but i think his eyes were glowing red.

the shadow man walks up to and i think starts talking to business man. i'm not sure if business man was pushed or fell, but he ended up toppling through the window. shadow man grabs his hands, effectively saving him. business looks downward at the street terrified and then back up at shadow. shadow's skin was a grayish color, with a sort of uneven, muddy, fibrous texture. my best description is like paper mache (however you spell it ).

at this point, business screams. shadow's hands are also the mud paper fiber texture, and his whole hand above the wrist breaks off and business falls to his assumed demise.

i then ran away to my room and had nightmares.

"venting form a mod. this kind of shit is common on this sub. we have a tiny set of rules, yet special snowflakes feel that their warmfuzzy youtube, amazon, vimeo, etc shit post should be given an exception. go elsewhere. it's really tiring listening to this.

&gt; your fellow moderator is a real piece of work. i posted on horrormovies because i have a youtube channel that i do not monetize. on the channel i narrate rare out of print horror novels like jason and freddy and stuff like that, i do this for fans to be able to experience these books since there is almost no way to even get these books anymore without spending hundreds of bucks online. so since i make no money in fact i give money away in the sense that once i finish my narrations i give my expensive books away to subscribers, because of these facts then my post cannot be considered marketing there is no profit being made by me gaining subs, i sincerely do this as a labor of love so other fellow horror fans who want to read these books but cant obtain them have a way to at least experience the books. this a sub about horror movie fans, these are horror movie novels that are extensions of the movies, i am doing something for fans, i do not benefit from it, so where is the harm in my post letting people know about the channel so they can go experience these horror titles? i really do not understand how that hurts this subreddit or benefits me? the ones it benefits are the fans, the people subscribed to your subreddit that might want to experience these horror books.  you may be just like the other mod if so i am wasting my time but but the way they are snarky and snide in their comment to me was really ridiculous and unfounded, i did not deserve that in the least.
&gt; 
&gt; if they are a teenage then i completely understand, but there is not excuse for an adult to act that way or to treat people who subscribe to your subreddit that way.

my reply:  
let's look at this. you feel he's immature. i have no idea where you live, but, i'm going to bet, it's on the planet earth and in the 21st century. given that, unless you are one of a few dozen folks who can afford their own island, then you live in a nation of humans that have rules to govern their interactions in public. those rules spell out specifics so that there is no confusion as to what is or is not permissible. follow the rules and you continue on your way. do not follow the rules and there are consequences. it's really pretty simple. some rules are part of complex interactions. others are simple, with minimal latitude, more or less, black and white. you as a citizen have some say, the degree of which is dictated by where you live.

you just tried to post in a subreddit that has some really basic rules with no interpretation, at all. one of which: no links to youtube. this was chosen because of all the shit eating assholes out there that just carpet bomb subs on a daily basis. it's a blanket rule because, frankly, it's a pain in the ass to deal with these immature fuckwits. i do not get paid to mod and really don't want to deal with a lot of shit since this sub was born out of the desire to just have discussions about horror. that's not to look at your shitty youtube vids. i don't know how stupid you are, but i'm going to bet the level is unreasonably high. since you think you are some special fucking snowflake that you alone are supposed to get a pass on the biggest rule of this sub. sorry, you asshat, i'm not here to hug you and reinforce that glasslike ego you got there. i am going to tell you that calling him out on his sub and saying his immature just proves that you are a useless pos and i'll chime in here with just letting you know when you get the ban notification it's from me. there are hundreds of subs to go promote your shit youbtube agenda. this is not one of them.

i hope this clears up any and all confusion, frankly, your ilk bores me to tears and i get too damn tired of having to listen to you whinge over this shit. you don't like it? make your own sub. 

and grow the fuck up. who gives a shit he said no? if you have kids, they must be horrible little turds since you seem to think everyone should get their own way. i cannot imagine you have a job even, since that ""i demand my way"" cannot go over well anywhere.

but, we're done. i've got to use the toilette and this bores me. you're also blocked, so i don't have to listen to you moan.

"halloween 2018 a little late to the party, but whatever. 

when i heard about this movie i felt worried, but hopeful. the halloween series has a track record of pumping out mediocre to bad movies and rewriting the series history with every new iteration. i do love the series but had no idea what they were gonna do with the story.

turns out, this one says ""fuck you"" to all the sequels and starts fresh from right after 1. that works for me, since the myers saga is all over the map, with each one after the first getting progressively worse (except for 3 which i don't lump in with the others) and shifting the history just a little to fit whatever narrative they're shitting out. but, this lets them bring back myers and laurie, and more jamie lee curtis is always awesome.

anyway, overall i quite liked it. it does for halloween what dark souls 3 did for the souls series, which is pay tribute to past versions over and over and over from within itself. fanservice, plain and simple, and lots of it. that's fine with me if it's done in a way that makes sense and works in the story, which in this case it does. there were a couple of parts that were a little questionable, but i won't go too far into detail on those for the people that haven't seen it.

carpenter and son do the soundtrack, which is awesome, but the majority of it is all remixes of the original theme, over and over, which is ok, but i would have loved to hear some original compositions from the two.

now for the downsides. 

i feel like there were a lot of buildups to other storylines that went nowhere and were ultimately a waste of time. also, there was one shot in particular where strodes granduaghter sat in a spot in the yard surrounded by mannequins and screamed for seemingly no reason, then she just got up and left like meh. during and after that scene i could only think ""why does this exist?"" it wasn't scary, funny, tense, or anything really. it just kind of was.

overall i enjoyed it, but i'm not sure where else the story can go.

also, jamie lee curtis still looks amazing, especially given that she's now 60. i'd love to see one more with her.

we have no idea what this film is, or what set it was on with the other horror movies. if you have any idea or know how to help please let me know. ",0

"movie scenes you can’t revisit ...or want to revisit ok sooooooo, i’m a horror fan. blood, guts and all. there’s many horror movies i’m a fan of (previous post) and that i can watch daily out of enjoyment/appreciation or even to help me get to sleep sometimes. but... sometimes a horror movie comes along that genuinely fucks me up and scares me senseless.
for example, there’s one scene in sinister that i will probably never watch again... or attempt to watch. the car scene. the kid traps his family in the car and sets it on fire. although it’s not exactly the scariest imagery, it’s the music that unsettled me so damn much. it’s so, so creepy. i think in general sinister wins for creepiest/eeriest soundtrack. but that scene in particular sticks in my head, the song playing in the background made me so uncomfortable. 
anyone else know which scene i’m talking about? i’ve watched some scary stuff... a lot more visually scary stuff... but sinister is a movie i just don’t plan on rewatching anytime soon. it’s disturbing af in my opinion.
another one off the top of my head, is a scene in the conjuring, when the two sisters are on their beds. one wakes up to the other sister looking terrified, staring at the corner of the room. ‘’what’s wrong?’’ ‘’can’t you see it?! it’s staring right at us....’’ nopenopenope!

"i miss fun horror movies. when i was a kid in the 80s, there were a lot of fun horror movies. not horror comedies, but movies that were a little on the lighter side and didn't take themselves too seriously. movies like fright night, silver bullet, poltergeist, an american werewolf in london, jason lives, etc.. we don't seem to get too many of these anymore. summer of '84 is one of the few i can think of. horror movie makers want to be so serious, all the time. we need more fun horror movies, i miss 'em.

"looking for a movie from my childhood sometime before 1988, i went to a family wedding in wisconsin. while there, we watched a movie late at night that terrified me, the most scary scene involved people in an elevator who were killed by several massive knives or blades were somehow hidden within the walls. i believe a magician was involved. people keep suggesting it was *the cube* but this movie was released too recently for this to be accurate",0
"looking for a movie from my childhood i'm looking for a movie from my childhood, after i watched it i was afraid to be alone for months. would like to watch it again, just to see what was that caused the fear.

i remember that it was in a house up in the hills, a ski camp or something like that, and a few people stuck there because the elevator did not work or something. they did not have enough food and started to eat rats ( not sure about this part ) , then towards the end it turns out that some of the organizers are aliens who can only live in cold. there is a scene where a guy takes off a snowman's nose, and turns out that it was one of the organizers covered in snow ...

the memory is very foggy, it was a long time ago ( probably in the 80s or 90s ) , but i hope it will ring a bell to someone.

"looking for a horror film from my childhood i can’t remember. my dad let me watch it, it scared the hell out of me, i barely remember anything. 

but, i do remember it was a bunch of people in a mansion or a hotel and it was storming outside (there was a scene where someone came in soaked with an umbrella in a study-like room). 

later there is a scene where they discover an older man dead hanging in a closet covered in what my childhood mind remembers as looking like locusts. 

and finally the last thing i remember is the younger man lead (who looked like he had long black hair and darker skin) leading them under the place with a lantern or a flashlight. 

i know this is vague. worth a shot. it’s haunted me for 35 years.

"veronica - opinions. so recently ive watched the movie on netflix veronica, apparently its one of the scariest stories on netflix, i watched it with my buddy and we both agreed that while it is scary its not your typical horror, its more in your head; you notice things that the protagonist do not. then you have to wait for them to realize it.

has anybody else watched this movie? if so, what are your opinions?",0

"haunting of hill house this show takes all of the source material and shits all over it. it has almost nothing to do with the original material. not that it's a bad thing really, but if you are coming into this with the expectation that it will be a serialized version of the 1959 novel or either of the movies then leave that notion at the door. 

i have been keeping an eye on mike flanagan after watching absentia, and he's been pretty solid... mostly. so i wanted to check this show out after hearing nothing but glowing reviews from other people.

it's good... mostly. 

it's an (incredibly) slow moving drama that's centered around the shared experiences of 7 family members and a haunted house that they lived in for a short while. each member of the family has issues of their own and things start clashing and blowing up after the family reunites after certain events transpire. 

it is very well acted and very well made, and the writing is about as top notch as it gets.

that said, i often found myself getting impatient and even frustrated at times. the show often sets up questions, and takes a long time to answer them, between family fights and flashbacks, it felt like it took forever to resolve certain plot points. 

the family banter is good, and the family arguing and fighting is often entertaining, but it gets tiresome after a while, and i often felt like i just wanted to see the plot move forward and didn't care as much about the family drama.

it also had a few startles every episode. there is horror littered in with the familys banter and bickering, but it's mostly jumpscares or set ups for jumpscares. this type of horror doesn't work well for me, i'm probably just an old curmudgeonly  jaded horror fan, but for me it didnt work. many of the jumpscares were predictable and telegraphed, and just felt like run of the mill haunted house scares. ghosts going ""boo!""

each episode feels like it's specifically centered around a character's story arch, where each of them tends to fill a tropey role. the psychic, the skeptic, the drug addict, the negative grumpy one, the vulnerable likeable one.. etc. after a while i just wished it would move forward instead of retelling the same story from different perspectives. 

i sound mostly negative, but overall it was a mostly enjoyable watch, of not a little slow and arduous. 

if slow moving drama is your bag, check it out. if it isn't, prepare to get impatient. 

it's like better call saul, without the humor or intensity, with the grudge style spooky jumpscares. 

6.5/10 for me, but probably a 9/10 if i wasn't so jaded.",0
"looking for a specific sort of horror movie. haunted location stories and movies, they’re very common. however, i’m developing an interest in how these places end up becoming haunted.

i’d like to watch some sort of movie that, instead of taking place in a haunted place (like a house), shows us a scenario that explains how said place became haunted, abandoned, cursed, etc. for example: a fully inhabited mansion, and a horrifying incident that caused pain and death to the people who used to live there.

"halloween 2018 review *spoiler free* god damn was i disappointed by this movie. jamie lee curtis does a good job but all the praise she is getting is unwarranted. my only guess is she just seemed so good cuz everyone else’s performance sucked (you too judy greer). the kill count is fairly high, but fully half of them happen off fucking screen! besides jamie’s character there is zero development for anyone else. as soon as they introduce most of the characters you immediately know they are just cannon fodder. and none of the kills are suspenseful, clever, interesting or even feel important. in fact this movie has nearly no suspense or atmosphere to speak of (save for one pretty good scene at the end). this entry felt very much like #6 the curse of michael meyers. also, i know the concept of laurie having ptsd and becoming hyper vigilant and hyper prepared seems cool, and it is, it only ever works in her favor. so when you give the protagonist in a slasher film some kind of advantage like that, it removes any sense of danger. oh, and danny mcbride boasting that this movie was gunna operate more in reality was fucking bull shit. michael was the same abominable golem he’s always been. in my opinion the only entries that matter are 1,2 and h20 (the famously water park themed entry). michael got his head chopped off by laurie in 1998 and that is it. everything else is the fevered wet dream of an idiot. this movie gets a 2/10 ",0

"my personal top 3 likes vs dislikes about 2007's halloween **here are the top 3 changes i liked in zombie's remake vs dislikes. apologies for the length, feedback's welcome:**

&amp;#x200b;

***likes:***

&amp;#x200b;

***1) elaborating on myers' childhood-*** there wouldn't be much creative point to a remake if it didn't take chances and show us a new side to familiar elements of the classic, especially regarding the infamous series star. tracking michael's transformation from a poor disturbed boy in a broken home, although a rather predictable/stereotypical narrative justification for his eventual insanity with no nuance whatsoever, was a clever and natural concept imo. i understand arguments that it ruins ""the shape's"" mystique, overly humanizing him as a man rather than ""evil on two legs"".

&amp;#x200b;

but the reality is, recapturing that mystique was an impossible task to begin with, regardless of approach. loomis' gradual buildup explaining michael's past from his pov instead of showing it worked in the original because that was audiences' introduction to him. we'd had 7 films since then (counting **season of the witch**) prior to the remake. fundamentally, there was no way to repeat that with modern audiences who were now heavily familiar with the character. the 1998 **psycho** remake made this exact mistake. so this change to compensate was for the better imo.

&amp;#x200b;

***2) michael hiding the mask at the house where he murdered his family, then retrieving it as an adult-*** this gives the iconic mask more narrative significance than in the original where he just steals it out of convenience from a store. the aged wear &amp; tear also gives a sense of history to the face while adding an appropriate air of mustiness, a reflection of myers' descent into darkness that's corrupted him into a decrepit echo of whatever innocence the boy once possessed.

&amp;#x200b;

***3) laurie defeating michael instead of loomis-*** the rivalry between loomis as the demonstrative guardian angel (or dr. frankenstein, depending on how you look at it) &amp; michael as the monster was a poetic recurring dynamic. however, again, as modern fans would've seen that coming and presumed michael was as good as finished the moment the two confronted each other, it was a good idea to have this conflict be a setup for the finale rather than the finale itself. jamie lee curtis honestly didn't do much against michael except scream, run, hide, and make an effort to fight back in the last few minutes. yes, her character was a child, but giving her a more active role this time improved the ""damsel"" stigma.

&amp;#x200b;

***dislikes:***

&amp;#x200b;

***1) the ""shock-sploitation"" tone-*** i'm sorry but i don't agree with rob zombie's direction at all. **halloween's** horror worked specifically because of its subtlety. this needless loud, crude gratuity directly undermined that winning formula. some cinematic styles are just too polar opposite in practice to coexist while keeping a coherent atmosphere. the sex obviously fits in context but the over-the-top shaky-cam, ramping up music in certain action sequences, moments of drawn out yelling, etc. there's a fine balance between building tension via human suffering vs coming off obnoxious.

&amp;#x200b;

ex- the mental hospital rape leading to michael snapping. where others may find that scene horrific or unsettling, i was increasingly annoyed and honestly hoping michael would kill everyone present just to shut- them- up- already. that is not the reaction quality horror should evoke. there's a reason the scariest parts are most often the quieter moments such as witnessing michael's intellect appearing from strategic shadowy hiding areas to approach victims.

&amp;#x200b;

***2) malcolm mcdowell's dr. loomis-*** compared to the late donald pleasence's more reserved, mannered, and experienced performance (in context of his relationship to michael), mcdowell came off miscast to me after the first half. he largely wastes his accumulated depth in getting to know young michael by later being an eccentric, exploitative, at times near-moronic a\*\*hole who doesn't understand or anticipate his ex-patient nearly as well as he should imo. loomis was conceptually a great foil to michael because he knew him and could usually follow or strategize against his next move. mcdowell had potential to improve the doctor's sense of guilt for failing to rehabilitate michael but even that falls apart.

&amp;#x200b;

***3) brad dourif's sheriff brackett  &amp; the general police incompetence-*** similarly to mcdowell, brad dourif's eccentricity made him a poor portrayal of brackett, a character whose demeanor worked best as an average-joe suburban sheriff. he wasn't a grizzled, crazy-eyed ""i've seen some s\*\*\*"" type of cop. he was an ordinary guy in over his head who needed loomis' help to track a psychopath the likes of which he'd never faced before, more of a middle-man kind of role.

&amp;#x200b;

the police in general had so little presence here that they may as well have been absent. even given that it's halloween night and they'd be out dealing with common holiday nuisances (drinking, noise complaints, etc), this was creatively lazy. it would've helped haddonfield's world-building and michael's eerie subtlety if they'd had at least a couple more conflicts between him and unlucky officers, brackett perhaps following this bloodshed among the rest as he &amp; loomis pursued.

&amp;#x200b;

***bonus: tyler mane as michael-*** **his brutality gave a new level of passion + intimidation to the character but that very height/build compromised his ability to blend in, which was part of what originally made myers scary.**

&amp;#x200b;

**comment below, what are your top likes &amp; dislikes about the zombie version's changes from carpenter's original?**",0

"90's horror movie with electric aliens? when i was about 6 my parents were watching a movie and it was scary to me so i assume it was a horror movie. from what i recall there were these spider-like (facehugger like?) aliens that hid in trees and would wait to drop down and would electrocute the person. i remember a dog getting electrocuted and the family was really upset. one fell out of a tree, and i think another attacked a guy in a car.

also from what i remember, the end of the movie involved a fight with a bigger form of the alien, like a queen, but the movie was definitely on earth, in a somewhat small town in the midwest. i'm pretty sure i had to go to bed at that point.

"tales from the hood 2 i didn't even know this was coming. if you know me or have followed my posts, you would know that i'm a sucker for anthology horror. as such, the first tales from the hood has always been a guilty pleasure. it's good, but a couple of the segments were too cheesy to take seriously. the ones that were good though, were pretty fucking good.  


i didn't even know this was coming until i saw it on a list of movies from the streaming site i always haunt. so, i decided to check it out on a whim.  


it's a lot of the same, but executed in a way that's... less good than the first one. there are parts that are supposed to be serious that come off as hilarious, and parts that (i think) are supposed to be funny but are just awkward. then, of course, there's the ham fisted ""racism is bad"" message laced throughout the whole movie, but with spike lee's name attached to it, you have to expect that.

a good watch, and pretty funny if you approach it as a comedy laced with dark drama, but it kind of falls flat as a horror, since it's not really scary and doesn't have any tension in it.

if you liked the first one, check it out. if you didn't, you probably won't like this one either.",0

"top 5 things i appreciate about the 2006 silent hill movie **here are the top 5 things i appreciate in the 2006 silent hill film despite still strongly disliking it as an adaptation:**

&amp;#x200b;

**1) production value-** unlike several video game films whose smaller budgets, amateur writers, and negligible efforts to translate source material make for a failure even as a coherent product, **sh** at the very least showed passion.

&amp;#x200b;

it was clear from the start that this project had a competent level of money + talent behind it to back the necessary elements (setting, creatures/makeup, effects, etc) that would bring the experience itself to life on the big screen.

&amp;#x200b;

however poorly it adapted the story or characters, there's no denying that this town at least sometimes genuinely captures that foreboding yet majestic atmosphere, suspense, and sense of loneliness even when surrounded by others.

&amp;#x200b;

**2) practical effects-** i can respect any horror film that at least attempts to create a breathing world &amp; creatures without reliance on cgi (though said cg is mostly utilized well for 2006 in necessary areas, despite having aged poorly in others).

&amp;#x200b;

the film's strongest effect imo is easily the nightmare world transitions, perhaps the best version of its transformation i've seen throughout the series. it's one of very few quality aspects western entries like **homecoming** added to the ip.

&amp;#x200b;

what dilutes this is the progressively repetitive over-the-top gore, over-compensating in needless gratuity until most of the psychological horror is consequently muddied. contrary to popular belief, fear &amp; disgust are not inherently linked.

&amp;#x200b;

the climax in particular never scared me at all, it simply killed my appetite for a while. granted, the original games were plenty bloody at points too but there was usually a narrative or symbolic purpose behind it that supported the tone.

&amp;#x200b;

**3) retaining &amp; committing to the core premise-** for everything it changed from the first game's admittedly complex plot (realistically, translating that story faithfully even in a 2 &amp; 1/2 hr film would've been impossible), the movie tried.

&amp;#x200b;

it emulated the protagonist's base-quest of searching &amp; fighting for his/her missing daughter, the ending of which went in an arguably disappointing direction but nonetheless stuck to its guns. it didn't try to copy any ending from the game.

&amp;#x200b;

**4) akira yamaoka's music-** the confidence to use that soundtrack for the whole film (as far as i remember, anyway) was a brilliant labor of love. ""you're not here"" playing over the credits was a near-perfect choice imo and my favorite part.

&amp;#x200b;

**5) atmosphere-** from the fog to the ruined architecture and sheer attention to detail in environments homaging the game (especially emulating that opening nightmare sequence), i sincerely felt in these moments like i was in silent hill.",0

"i need a new movie list: from a seasoned horror vet  

## hey, guys! i am a huge horror fan. i have watched hundreds of horror movies and read dozens of horror books. i did just recently join the world of reddit however. i naturally gravitated straight to all of the scary, horror, creepy, etc., subreddit's. they have been keeping me busy and allowing me to pass my free time in between classes and work. but, i am starting to miss watching scary movies.

now when it comes to scary movies i've seen huge amount of them. nothing pushes me away as far as content.

i have been attempting to slowly move my wife into watching horror movies, but she hates being scared. so i have decided to slowly start introducing her to the genre. my idea is to introduce her the way i was introduced, which is through thrillers first. just something that will introduce her to the adrenaline that horror inflicts. then move onto psychological thrillers and then onto true horror. so i have two questions for all of you!

1. what are some of your favorite horror movies? i have seen a lot but i haven't seen them all, so if you have any recommendations for films. foreign, underrated, less known, hugely popular, anything. i just wanna watch some good flicks and get scared.
2. what track would you suggest i take my wife on? what is the best way to introduce her slowly? what are some movies you think we should start with? i think that i might show her some classics, texas chainsaw massacre, children of the corn, jeepers creepers, etc. i feel as though those have scary topics, but aren't modern stereotypes and the acting is just very dramatized which takes some of the scary out of it.

"[the nun - conjuring connection][spoiler] how did lorraine warren actually got the vision of valak i just watched the nun yesterday, and i am really amazed by the connection james wan created between nun story and conjuring 1.

i get it, maurice got the vision/possession of valak and other creatures of hell (which we saw in conjuring 1 and at the end of the nun) when valak, itself possessed him during the final battle.

that being said, i am still confused that how did lorraine actually got the visions of valak, she just performed exorcism on him and that's it.

can anybody explain this phenomenon, that how exactly did visions of valak transferred from maurice to lorraine in current timeline of conjuring-verse.

&amp;#x200b;

ps: is there any connection between the nun ie sister irene (taissa farmiga, sister of vera farmiga) and lorraine warren (vera farmiga) ? 

i really thought that irene was gonna break her vows or not gonna take them in the first place and will proceed towards having a family with maurice which results in lorraine warren as her daughter or grand--daughter, that's how lorraine was able to get gift of visions.

&amp;#x200b;

but that wasn't the case and we all know how did it turned out.

"so i watched unfriended.... for me, the start of it was all a bit ""how do you do, fellow kids?"".  the acting wasn't great, which made the film unrealistic and hard to take seriously.  the dialogue was just predictable and got boring really fast (teens want to go to the prom, lose their virginity etc etc.. kind of been done to death, made me cringe). that being said, the ""never have i ever"" scene genuinely did shock me when they were forced to reveal dark secrets about themselves, making them turn on each other.  they also do a good job of making the characters extremely un-likeable, i don't know if that was the intention, though.  it makes their deaths morbidly satisfying to watch.  i especially hated the main character, blaire, because she shamelessly lied and manipulated things throughout the entire film.  i also liked how they (sort of) gave the message that bullying can have horrific consequences and how they showed it in a very negative light, albeit the delivery of the message was a little clunky. 

so yeah, it started off pretty bad and almost un-watchable, but i was pleasantly surprised later on in the film. ",0
"suicide club - questions &amp; comments hello everyone, this is my very first post on reddit (:

so, one of my favorite horror films of all times is the japanese 2002 ""suicide club"" flick (which personally, i would also classify as a psychological thriller). i've watched this movie countless of times, marveling at its uniqueness and thought-provoking elements. the other day i watched it again, and decided to write down some questions that arose during the screening.  i would like to hear your opinions and comments, and apologize in advance if some of these things were already discussed in previous posts.

so here goes:

 \- spoilers ahead!!! - 

1. near the beginning of the film, one nurse kills herself jumping out the window, while her colleague is out fetching some food. afterwards that colleague returns with the food, hands it over to the security guard, and jumps out the window as well. the thing is, i've always wondered if what the guard witnesses is already the ghost of the colleague. the reason being that once the colleague returns to the hospital, the lights all shut off. then, after she jumps, the lights switch back on (while the guard is terrified and screaming). what'ya think? was that a ghost? after all, sakura, police officer kuroda's daughter appears behind her dad, all covered in blood, after committing suicide, in a ""ghostly"" fashion..
2. speaking of supernatural elements, if this movie is supposed to be rooted in pure psychology, why then do we see the infamous white bag slides across the hospital corridor by itself? in previous scenes we could clearly see someone simply putting it there. 
3. after the mass suicide at the school, we see that one of the jumpers had lost an ear. later on, we see that mitsuko almost has her own ear cut off when her boyfriend jumps on her while committing suicide himself. do you think there's some sort of meaning to ears in the movie?
4. why do the mysterious children keep clearing their throat while speaking to the policemen on the phone?
5. and for that matter, who are these kids anyway? how do they succeed taking control of adults, why do they have baby chicks spread around, and why to they wear yellow raincoats?
6. who was the man near the end, who hung himself with christmas lights, dropping the skin bag?

finally, i'd like to add that the way i interpret this movie - at least partially - is that it deals with a person's connection to themselves. the kids keep asking the adults ""after you die, your connection to your loved ones would still remain. but will your connection with yourself remain?"" seemingly, dessart band is subconsciously pushing people to confront this very question, and most people can't actually deal with it (mistuko was one of the few people who could confront this matter, as she was ""marked"" by the children in the end, but did not die). all the while, the concept of suicide becomes a romanticized fetish, as do all fleeting teen trends.

as said, would love to hear your thoughts on the matter \^\^ ",0

"hereditary after hearing people either complain that it sucked or whine that it isn't scary, i decided to check it out for myself.

it's definitely unlike other supernatural centric movies i've seen, but still predictable in spots.

it's good, overall, but i feel like the spooky stuff that happens is a side effect, and the central plot is about the family falling apart after a series of dark tragedies. 

there are many metaphors. some direct and as subtle as a mack truck, and there are some that you really have to read to find meaning.

all that said, it was a good movie overall.

it didn't scare me, but nothing does anymore, so i can't speak to its scare factor. i will say that it's incredibly well made in every aspect.

i will say that i love toni collette, and she gives a phenomenal performance here, so it's worth watching just for that.

hereditary does for the family drama what  the ring does for vhs tapes; gives them a spooky edge.

worth watching/10. even just for toni collette.",0
"searching 2018 not really horror, but a mystery/thriller. as a parent though, this definitely qualifies as horror to me.

regardless, it takes place in a series of computer screens and various other device interfaces, kind of like unfriended, but much better.

anyway, it has many predictable moments, but is overall very well made and very well acted, with a few odd red herrings and some twists. 

it comes off as a little technophobic at times, but does display both positives and negatives of the digital age.

the technology portions are accurate and well done, which is rare for these kinds of movies.

check it out if you are able.

"summer of 84 first off, the soundtrack is amazing, but i'm a child of the 80s, so all the synth really resonates with me.

anyway, i won't spoil anything here, not that there's a whole lot of mystery even from the get go. 

it's a classic formulaic thriller that gets it roots from hitchcock (rear window specifically), disturbia, and stand by me. it's the classic ""did the supposed bad guy actually do it or not"" kind of mystery film, and since stranger things spiked in popularity, drawing from movies like stand by me and the goonies, you can pretty much already know what you're getting into, but with a lot of juvenile sex and your mom jokes. which i enjoyed.

the suspense is done well, and the whole movie is pretty well acted. the kids all do an amazing job, as do the parents.

the complaints i'd have would be the constant fucking jumpscares and how unrealistic some parts of the story are. their walky talkies must be powered by cellular technology, because i had them as a kid and i can tell you that we were lucky to get them to work from across the house, let alone the entire fucking town.

the ending was surprisingly nihilistic, which i like, because it's a change from the run of the mill hollywood ending.

a little alien sphere goes inside a blonde teacher’s body while she’s sleeping on the couch and calls herself “ula,” while a group of kids look her up on the computer only to find out “ula” doesn’t exist.
ula is discovered to be eating a chicken violently, hanging the chicken upside down while chomping sounds are evident, the kids horrified since the parents were invited to some kinda dinner party.
the same party, ula scares the kids and parents as a “fun” game by only having a fake green hand touch the doorway, then she appears by saying, “boo!” and everybody is laughing, while the kids are concerned.
the main character, a boy with his father are having dinner, “ula,” confesses she ate her male mate on another planet while touching his hand.
during the plot twist, ula shrinks one of the male teachers to the size of her finger, and eats him.
at the end of ula’s defeat, the boy says to ula after she rambles on, on being a good stepmom she would make; “ula, you would make a terrible stepmother,” while using the final move to kill her.

one guy died wearing a demon mask so he resurrected as something like a demon monster. one of the girls died dressed up as cat-like creature so she became that. and then there was this one guy who got run-over(not sure if he really was run-over) and then he turned into some kind of mangled mess of a zombie.
